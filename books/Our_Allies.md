## The Friends We Made

Over the years, our relationship to both Light and Darkness has changed. The nuance of the universe has often been ignored by Humanity in favor of black-and-white boxes that make existence easier to grasp. Just as we have begun to open ourselves up to that nuance, so, too, have we begun to understand our former enemies and even forge alliances with them.

Most recently, both Empress Caiatl of the Cabal and Commander Zavala saw the threat of the Hive as larger than the differences between her people and ours. Similarly, a group of Fallen, known in their own language as Eliksni, have put aside the bad blood between our peoples to form the House of Light under the leadership of Mithrax, Kell of Light. They now live alongside us in the City and have become trusted allies.
