## The Tower

As every Guardian knows, there are few dull moments in Sol, but any precious downtime is most often spent in the hangars and hallways of the Tower. Operating as a base of operations for the Vanguard, the Tower overlooks the Last City and the Traveler, serving as a watchful eye should any threats arise. 

As the seasons change, so, too, does the Tower. Guardians looking to partake in holiday events and festivals like, Guardian Games, Solstice, Festival of the Lost, and the Dawning, will find Eva Levante leading the celebrations with special activities and decorations galore!
