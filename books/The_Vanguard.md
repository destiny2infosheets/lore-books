## The Leaders Who Guide Us

The Vanguard is the Last City's greatest defense and first line of offense when a threat presents itself. The organization is comprised of a long, storied line of elite Guardians with a leader chosen for each of the classes: Hunter, Titan, and Warlock.

Commander Zavala serves as Titan Vanguard. A force of nature, as unyielding as he is deadly. He has led the Guardians to victory in countless battles, and the moment a threat presents itself, the Last City looks to him as both a leader and a protector.
 
Ikora Rey serves as the Warlock Vanguard. An unmatched scholar, and one of the most formidable Warlocks in the history of the Last City. She oversees the Vanguard's intelligence network known as The Hidden.

Currently, the Hunter Vanguard position remains open. The title once belonged to Cayde-6, a Guardian as quick with a gun as he was with a joke. He met his final death after his Ghost was killed—a sobering reminder that even Guardians can be slain. A statue of him stands in the Tower to keep his memory alive.
