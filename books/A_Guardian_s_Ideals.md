# A Guardian's Ideals

## Guiding Light

It takes considerable skill to master the greatest challenges in Sol, but it takes a very dedicated and patient Guardian to step up and lead others through these daunting tests. Every experienced Guardian was once a New Light. You may reminisce on your own first time in the deepest pits of the Moon; what advice would you give to yourself from those early days? Those who take the time to share their expertise are an invaluable part of the Guardian community. 

Becoming a leader isn't just about being "the best," it's about dedicating the time and effort to helping others become their best.
