# Guardians and Ghosts

© Bungie

## What It Means…

You are a Guardian, a warrior forged in the Traveler's Light who has chosen to defend humanity. A beacon of hope in a universe constantly threatened by forces that would see it destroyed, or worse…

Chosen by the Traveler and raised from the dead by Ghosts, Guardians are part of the rare few able to wield paracausal abilities to manipulate the world around them. For centuries they have defended the City, but now they have extended their reach to Sol, protecting all who call this solar system home. 

Retake our lost worlds, forge unexpected alliances, and harness the power within yourself. The Guardians who lead the way will save humanity—and become legend.

## A Guardian's Best Friend

Created by the Traveler's Light, Ghosts seek out their Guardian companions among the dead. The Ghost can be scout, librarian, and mechanic; ancient machinery guiding their Guardians forward. In the right situations, your Ghost can even save you from death.

But Ghosts are not immortal. As far as Guardians know, every loss is irreplaceable.

## The Traveler

Everything changed when the Traveler arrived in Sol.

It gave us gifts that transformed the solar system and the nature of human life. Moreover, it ushered in the Golden Age, a renaissance of scientific and cultural achievement. Despite all the good it has done for us, we still know nothing of the Traveler's origin or the reason it gifted Lightbearers with paracausal powers.
 
Unbeknownst to us, each of those miracles came at a price. Threats greater than we could have ever fathomed have found their way to our doorstep in pursuit of the Traveler.
