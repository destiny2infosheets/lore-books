## Raids and Dungeons

As they grow into their powers and skills, Guardians often find themselves in need of a challenge. Should you wish to take your adventures to the next level, treacherous dungeons and powerful foes are the perfect way to test your mettle. 

A well-equipped fireteam of three may face difficult combatants and precarious environments as they make their way through a dungeon. Should they wish for an even bigger challenge, a fireteam of six Guardians can work together to take on Sol's biggest threats in a raid.
