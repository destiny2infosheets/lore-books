LaGrange's translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\nA Dreg fell. Left to die. A forgotten pirate set on a path toward salvation. His crew had raided the Moon looking for Ether. They found only death. And then he was alone.\n\nHiraks, the small. Hiraks, the timid, the weak was lost to the depths of the Hellmouth. A solitary scavenger down among the hollows where dead things dwell. How he survived is a story untold, an impossible tale known only to Hiraks himself.\n\nIn that secret is his strength.\n\nFor poor, weak, pathetic Hiraks came out of that hell as something other. Still Fallen. Still alone. But changed by all he'd seen and learned—his mind opened, set adrift through the wonders of all the nightmares he had never imagined.\n\nSome say he spent his time hidden in the shadows of that cruel land scouring the mysteries of the Worlds' Grave. Others suggest he peered into a hateful shrine and found truth in the unutterable horrors whispered from the abyss.\n\nTruth is, only Hiraks knows. Truth as simple as it is puzzling: Yes. Yes, he did. Scour the Grave. Hear the whispers. Only then could all that followed transpire.\n\nFor a lowly Dreg to rise from their docking to stand as a Baron is rare enough, but that a Fallen of any stature could crack the layers of understanding that barricade the known universe from the ascendant plane is more than improbable. It was impossible.\n\nUntil it wasn't.\n\nFor Hiraks succeeded where so few have. He crafted his own throne world and began a monstrous quest to expand his knowledge, etching its harshest truths upon his enemies. And his work has progressed unchecked.\n\nIt is his name the children do not speak when sharing tales of the Haunting of Nemesis. It is his blood that Paladins and Corsairs alike wish to spill for the Slaughter at Gaspra.\n\nHiraks, the Twisted. Hiraks, Ascendant. The mindbender whose tongue is a weapon, whose experiments seek to unravel sanity and reshape imagination that his subjects may become other—tools of his vile bidding.\n\nAnd so, the warnings spread…\n\nWhen the Fallen who speaks in the language of the damned calls, do your best not to listen, for once his words take hold, your will shall fade, replaced by its antithesis.\n\nAnd then, like that poor, weak, fallen Dreg… you too will know darkness.\n\nYou too will be alone."

Who has killed more rivals than have ever risen to her challenge.\n\nWhat is known and unknown? None can say. And the sly prankster would have it no other way.\n\nOf all the Barons marked by scorn, it is Araskes to fear, for her greatest weapon is the dissolution of truth. She will give you certainty, only to reshuffle the deck. She will grant you your desire, only to reveal it is truly regret.\n\nIf this realm can allow for gods, then she may be the first among devils—unknowable, unpure. Her tongue will cut you down long before your body falls. If you don't believe—if you find yourself questioning the depths of her deceit—ask yourself a simple question:\n\nDid you kill her?

LaGrange's translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\nIt was Reksis Vahn who saw to the final days of the House of Wolves. With cold hatred, he hunted and slaughtered their Servitors until none remained, and thus a rabid House did fall.\n\nBut Reksis Vahn's rage was not sated, as the Wolves alone were not the architects of his fury—all Fallen who clung to the ritual of House politics were his enemy, total and complete.\n\nIt is told that he was starved as a young Dreg. He watched in agony as others grew strong while he and his closest brothers and sisters were kept low. They were unworthy, pathetic, unwanted. But Reksis was ever aware. He saw the lie of the Archon's worship—how Servitors were revered upon a pedestal of godhood as a means to control the masses.\n\nMaybe there was a time when the Fallen theology was one with greater concerns. No more. The Houses fractured, at war with one another. Old graces long since neglected in favor of a more desperate purpose—survival.\n\nWhile cast low, Reksis found strength in his growing hatred. Only when he found common disdain among those twisted outcasts who would call themselves Scorned—who wore their hated derision as a badge of honor—did Reksis also find an outlet for his anger. His new brothers and sisters saw great value in his unchecked aggression. They were all a bit mad in their own right. All a bit twisted.\n\nBut where others slipped toward insanity, Reksis's mind and intent were clear—the agony of a terrible death was his aim. The target of his wickedness, the very Servitors he had been denied. The very machines that sustained the Fallen.\n\nHe would tear and slice and rend their metal until their hissing deaths rang across the Shore, the Reef… the entire system. He would make all who do not stand with the Scorned Barons feel the anguish he once felt, tenfold.\n\nAnd he would do so gleefully, watching the life drain from their eyes."

LaGrange's translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\nPirrha, the Phantom. Pirrha, the Blind. The Fallen Baron with the all-seeing eye and the crack-shot. The Awoken link him to the legend, \"The Ghost of Hellrise Canyon,\" believing it was Pirrha, and Pirrha alone, who haunted the winding depths, picking off intruders and holding off Corsair raiding parties as his fellow Barons planned their violent reign in the maze of caverns near the canyon's heart.\n\nHe was unseen during the Wolves uprising, but many credit him with the assassination of the Queen's palace guard. None can verify, but each fell to a single shot—clean, precise, fatal.\n\nBut how can a blind pirate who had been discarded and scorned by his House become the deadliest shot this side of Mars?\n\nThis is where the Barons' true strength hides. They are each a devil worthy of your hate, but together they are so much more. Not simply devils, but Hell itself—manifest, angry, and aggressive.\n\nRumors and legend merge to tell of the Machinist's expert hand, the Rifleman's cybernetic eye and a link between his sight and the tracking systems on his rifle.\n\nWhat he sees, he hits.\n\nWhat he hits, he kills.\n\nThere is evidence of Fallen giving themselves to technology. Becoming other—becoming more—as they marry their physical selves to enslaved mechanics. The mercenary Taniks is one example—more machine than Fallen now, an abomination in the eyes of traditional Fallen belief. The Splicers and their augmentation through SIVA—a twisted experiment brought low by the mighty hand of the heroes of Iron. Is Pirrha any different?\n\nThe Barons and Taniks and the Splicers are each and all individual dangers, driven by their own ambition. They are more likely to wage war with one another than see their commonality.\n\nYet are they not of a kind? Are they not evidence of something greater wending its way through the Fallen's dying culture?\n\nAre they not the warning signs of a new terrible evolution?\n\nOne can only wonder—and hope—these horrid amalgamations of life and technology are simply outliers and not a promise of tomorrows yet to come."

LaGrange's translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\nThe Ragged Valley is long and harsh and no valley at all. Not by traditional definition. Its hollow length runs between a series of lashed asteroids on the Shore's far western edge.\n\nThey call it a \"valley\" to be poetic, but in truth, it is simply the chaotic space between massive rocks that scrap and smash into one another in a violent dance. The distances from mass-to-mass ebb and flow without warning—a constant, deadly repositioning of the landscape. That ever-changing hollow is the Valley. Only the mad and desperate would dare run its length. With one exception…\n\nYaviks. The Rider.\n\nThe reason she made the run changes with the telling. You know she is neither mad nor desperate what with her skills on a Pike and killer determination. But the run itself—it's a legend as awe-inspiring as any Guardian's, save the fact Yaviks is a wicked beast and better off dead. The story goes…\n\nShe was running Ether… or making off with lost Golden Age tech. Some say Clovis Bray science. Others tell it was drivers from a forgotten Warmind. Or maybe she'd just dropped a Guardian and was running full-throttle from a fireteam set on revenge—a common theme this far out. Or was it pride? Did a Captain or a Kell or an Archon challenge her ability to ride? Did Fikrul? After all, their relationship is… complicated.\n\nNone of that matters. Not to me. Each version of the start is as interesting as the next. But the run itself? Her ride through the gnashing jaws of death?\n\nMost Guardians who have heard it dismiss it. Don't want to give credit to one so infamous—the Scorned Baron with the blood on her hands, the loot in tow and her burners set to top speed—but she deserves it. Don't believe me. Ask Marcus Ren.\n\nHe wasn't there that day, but he'd heard tell and couldn't believe. So he made the run himself. Four goes. No dice. One resurrection. Four Sparrows busted to rubble.\n\nMarcus Ren, the Sparrow Racing League champion and hero to speed junkies and race hounds City-wide, couldn't sprint that Valley. \"Too random,\" he said. \"Too chaotic. Can't read the rock one minute to the next. Can't read the angles.\"\n\nBut he tried again, and on the fifth go, he scraped through a narrow as the collision hit. He'd made it. The impossible was possible, though he refused to admit Yaviks could've done the same. Not that it mattered.\n\nThat Ren had come out alive proved it could be done, and if it could—why not Yaviks?\n\nNot that Yaviks ever cared for validation. Not yours. Not Ren's. Not any Guardian's. Not any Fallen's. Not anyone's.\n\nShe took pride in recognition from her brother and sister Barons and no others."

To look anywhere else is a lie.\"\n—Excerpt from C.C. LaGrange's translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\nFikrul was an Archon.\n\nThen Fikrul took a fall—beaten, docked, and banished for heresies against Eliksni faith.\n\nHe should have died—alone and starved of precious Ether.\n\nHe did not. Instead, he found kin in the form of seven scorned. With them, he found purpose and power. As their legend grew, he found believers and new truth. His banishment was not penance, it was reward—for his convictions, for his courage.\n\nFikrul, the crazed fanatic. Fikrul, the heretic Archon who spoke against the very faith he once held dear. Scorned and forgotten—but only for so long.\n\nFikrul was a Dreg.\n\nBefore his banishment—before his clarity of purpose—Fikrul was a celebrated leader of Fallen faith and a savior to those who embraced his teaching.\n\nArchons had long been elevated in Fallen society, but their stature grew, and their role shifted following the Whirlwind. As desperation took hold and the last of the Fallen raced across the stars in search of salvation, their dependence on machines evolved into a deep-rooted need—their weapons to fight, their ships to fly, their Servitors to survive.\n\nThat need became worship. That worship became faith. And the Archons—those who oversaw the care and consecration of the Servitors—were looked upon to provide hope through their words, teachings, and interpretations of the machines' wants, needs… desires.\n\nBut Fikrul saw another path—one that would later be mimicked and twisted by the techno-deviant Splicers in the Plaguelands of Earth while he and his explored their own darker interpretations of faith.\n\nFikrul is a Fanatic.\n\nScorned and abandoned.\n\nFikrul is all who strive to regain strength of self and purpose. He is a survivor. He is the outcast priest of the broken plains, and his sermon is death and all the glory that follows.\n\nIn Fikrul's eyes, and those of the outcasts who rallied to his philosophies, machines were not superior. They were not gods. They were tools. Instruments to be mastered and controlled and manipulated in service of Eliksni pride. None should grovel for Ether. None should have their honor bound to the whims of manufactured deities.\n\nBut the evolution of Fikrul's faith did not end there. If the machines—the very things that had regulated the whole of their existence—were tools, why not life itself? Why not death?\n\nThere are many tales of the time between Fikrul's fall and his rise again as spiritual leader of the Scorned Barons—his struggle to find strength as a battered Dreg, his journeys across the system to challenge his faith, his joining with the other outcasts who were scorned, and his eventual union with his \"father.\" The only thing that matters, however, when confronting the dangers of Fikrul is this: He is a creature of faith.\n\nHis faith is the antithesis of all who stand in the Light. That faith has raised an army. That army will baptize all who challenge its purpose in an unending sea of death. They will never stop. They will never give in. Because they know they are right.\n\nAnd everything you stand for is wrong."

LaGrange's translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\nIt was Elykris, the Machinst, who'd begun hoarding the Servitors. And Reksis, the Hangman, who slaughtered them at every turn. Two allies driven by opposing forces—one science and the unmaking of faith, the other rage and its relentless push to destroy.\n\nThere had long been tension between the two, as Reksis had, more than once, slipped into the Machinist's workshop to inflict himself on the Servitors caged there.\n\nFikrul, the Fanatic—their spiritual leader and one-time Archon Priest—watched patiently as their rivalry grew. He saw strength in their ire. He saw fire and fury, but also more—a new path forward. One that could join their passions and drive them further—a whole stronger than its warring parts.\n\nFikrul waited, biding time as tensions rose and threatened to splinter the Barons' loyalties. Only when Elykris could take no more, on a night when she caught the Hangman prepared to slaughter her latest haul of lesser Servitors, did Fikrul step in.\n\nFikrul motioned to Elykris and said, \"Bring me a Servitor.\" As Reksis hissed with anticipation, she hesitated, but Fikrul was patient. \"Where is your trust?\"\n\nElykris released a Servitor from its bondage.\n\nFikrul motioned the Servitor closer, then turned to Elykris. \"You have gathered many, Machinist. Hundreds. Maybe more. Our own supply—our life force fed by slaved mechanics.\" Elykris nodded to the Servitor as it inched closer to the Archon's open arms—welcoming the once revered orb as one would a child.\n\nThe other Barons began to bark, a rhythmic warriors' chant.\n\n\"For all the value in your work… it is not enough to feed ourselves.\" Fikrul hugged the Servitor. There was a tenderness to the embrace. A sorrow. \"We must also starve our enemies, as you were once starved.\" With a blur, Fikrul's lower arms unsheathed and triggered a pair of polished, sparking Shock Blades. \"As were we all.\"\n\nThe Servitor, still held with the clutches of the Archon's powerful upper arms, cried a shrill, digital wretch—pain mixed with confusion as the blades carved its outer shell and plunged deep into the core of its systems. Ether hissed and sprayed.\n\nFikrul released the machine's silent shell, and it clanged lifeless to the ground. He turned to Elykris. \"Do you see?\" Elykris smiled. She was ever the brightest among them, though her focus could lose clarity when she became frenzied.\n\nThe Barons had long been trouble for the Awoken and Fallen of the Reef, but that trouble had been limited to hit-and-run tactics. What Fikrul had just presented was a new way.\n\nFikrul stepped to Reksis. \"Do you see?\" The brute barked in response, \"Kill them all!\"\n\nFikrul laughed. \"Not 'all,' Hangman. Just the ones we do not need.\" \n\nThe Barons cheered as Fikrul continued, \"Every Servitor—any Servitor—bound to a House is now a target. Until none remain but those upon whom we feed.\""

Eris calls a lotta things something different. \n\nI miss that girl.\n\nBut here I am stalling—buying time.\n\nThis ain't easy for me.\n\nThought it would be. Easy, I mean. Or, at least… easier than this. Thought a lot of things would be easier. Hell… Thought a lotta things about a lotta things. But maybe that's what makes me the person I am. Makes any of us part of humanity—all our big thoughts and big plans, hopes and dreams and all that squishy nonsense.\n\nOK, fine, look: If I'm playing at honesty, and I think that's what I'm doing here, maybe those hopes and dreams are all that really matters. Just, not losing sight of them is the hard part. Life is full of those little distractions that fudge the edges, make those hopes and dreams a little blurrier.\n\nThat's the power of \"maybes,\" I suppose—the temptation of… playing both ends against the middle.\n\nMaybes provide… wiggle room. And I like my edges fudgy. And I loooooves me some wiggle room. But if I'm gonna stay true to this whole rambling \"dear diary\" how-do-ya-do business, guess what I'm sayin' is…\n\nGuess what I'm saying is, I'm sick of \"maybes.\" And, if I'm a straight shooter—and I'm nothing if not—then I gotta shoot straight… even when there ain't a gun in my hand.\n\nSo, let's… let's keep this between me and you, OK?\n\nHere's the deal: My name is Cayde-6…\n\nAnd this is my story."

I'm gonna hit the important stuff, sure, but what I'm really after here is a sense of… a sense of me. Because once you understand me, you just might understand where I'm coming from, why I do the things I do, and why I've done the things I've done.\n\nSo, read between the lines if you have to, but end of the day? Everything that matters should be readily apparent. If not, you're not paying attention.\n\nSo here goes…\n\nUs Exos are haunted.\n\nSounds ominous, I know, and maybe a bit of a stretch. But really, it's the best word—kinda sets the stage in a way the raw facts don't.\n\nSee, Guardians have all got past lives. But unless you returned with any definitive info on your person or in proximity (I'm looking at you, Bray), that past life, or lives, was, or were, wiped clean. Gone. Reborn in the Light and all, you become what you become.\n\nExos, though?\n\nWe've got ghosts in our machines. Not capital-G \"open doors and know things\" Ghosts. I mean, like fragments of— I don't know, pieces of something that could be memory. Whatever it is, it's enough to give us a starting point to maybe, possibly, imagine who we were before we became who we are. And then there's the dreams—but I ain't touching that with a ten-foot Arc Staff.\n\nMe? I'm one of the lucky few. The fudgy flashes of that old Exo life weren't all I had to go on. See, the \"me\" that was in my life before my trusty capital-G Ghost found me kept journals, like mementos—fragments of my prior life that give me a baseline of who I was.\n\nThe journals are personal, and I keep personal close to the chest. I've shared a few pages, sure, but only with right-minded types who could find a little value in seeing the man behind the myth.\n\nYeah, \"myth,\" I said it. Who are we kidding? You've heard of me. Who hasn't? Point is… I don't make a show of personal business.\n\nFirst, because it's MY fuel to burn. Second, because Big Blue ain't a big fan of his Guardians poking around what they used to be—something about duty, rules, not losing sight of why we were chosen. But more than any of that… most of us \"Chosen Ones\" don't have the luxury of a past, so rubbing it in doesn't seem right.\n\nLook, all I know is…\n\nWhen I rejoined the land of the living, the pre-Light version of me was kind enough to lend a guiding hand. I took that hand, gave it a high five, and followed its example the best I could.\n\nAll this time later, I may not know my true purpose—I leave the big-ticket, existential questions to the Warlocks—but I know this…\n\nMy calling is to do good. Maybe not always to \"be\" good, ya know, but do good. There's a difference.\n\nAnd if I don't always go about it in a manner that fits the textbook definitions of \"hero\" or \"team player\"—I'm looking at you, Big Blue—just know…\n\nI might dance to my own tune, but we're all at the same hoedown…\n\nOr something like that."

Not many people know that. Fine by me. I don't like to brag.\n\nTrue, I never wanted the Vanguards' life, but that's not because I didn't see its value. Just that its value fit others better than me. Besides, few can do what I do. Hell, few would even try. I mean, come on… It's me.\n\nThe places I've been. The trouble I've seen… caused… whatever. Was a time Shiro, Andal, the crew, and me would do more good doing bad than the mightiest Titan ever dreamed.\n\nThe trails we blazed. The supplies we recovered—pilfered, filched, scammed, stole, found, uncovered, looted. We weren't the only ones, but the world outside the City got a whole lot bigger thanks to us.\n\nYeah, sure, I don't get out as much, but I'm fixing to change that.\n\nZavala won't like it—never does. Ikora will try to convince me otherwise—always does. But we've seen how precious our Light is… How fleeting. Gotta use it while we got it…\n\nDo good. Be good. Push the limits. Take back what's ours.\n\nAnd that was my first bet… All in. Day 1. I bet on myself.\n\nI saw the edge of those dark ages. You've heard the stories. If not, look them up. Scary stuff. Real eye-opener. I've seen the City grow. And fall. And grow again—stronger. I seen the best of us, and the worst. And I'll fight to ensure we stick around long enough to see that \"best\" turn to better and that \"worst\" fade to memory.\n\nSo, yeah… I'm a loudmouth and a braggart, and I'm quick with a blade and fast on the draw. And if you need it found, fought, killed, saved, or stashed for safe keepin', few can do it better. But in the end…\n\nI'm only good because he was good.\n\nI like to think I learned that from myself—that the notes left by the \"me-that-was-before-me\" set the stage. That Five figured, back in those dark days, that Six might not turn out all that nice and end up a Seven. So that former \"me\" wrote me a road map to the version of him—or me—that would be a better man.\n\nSo, whatever hand I was dealt, when the bet was placed and it was time to call, no matter what—I had an Ace and a Queen up my sleeve.\n\nMeaning I couldn't lose.\n\nMeaning the better man would always win."

Hunter part of the Vanguard before yours truly. More importantly…\n\nHe was my friend. A brother, even.\n\nAndal and I used to run with one heck of a crew. This was before he got himself roped into fireteaming up with the top brass. Oh, we were legendary. Ran scouting parties looking for survivors to lead back City-side. Mapped lost sites where old tech or supplies might still be worth the salvage. Hunted plenty of Fallen. Never an easy task. Especially in the early days.\n\nAnd by \"early days,\" I mean my early days. Lot of Guardians been around longer than me, but even in my newborn new life, the City had a lotta growing up to do. And us Guardians had a hell of a lot to learn. Trouble is, we only ever seem to learn the hard way…\n\nThe Red War. That time Crota woke up cranky and slapped around more Guardians than I can count. Twilight Gap. And all the bad that happened before my time. The Iron Lords and their tussle with SIVA. …Six Fronts.\n\nAnd those are just the headline grabbers. So many lessons learned. So many lives lost. But, in truth…\n\nI've always felt it's the day-to-day struggles where we learn the most about the world, about ourselves. Being inside the City walls, sure, we're reminded of what we're fighting for. But outside the walls…?\n\nIt puts a face to all we've lost. Puts a reality to how far we've fallen. Abandoned roads, crumbling cities—rust and ruin, ruin and rust.\n\nBut if the City gives us reason to fight for the now, those old, dead places always give me hope for tomorrow. Rusted, broken skeletons or not… If you squint, you can see all we were and all we can be.\n\nThat's why, when Andal left the road and joined the Vanguard, me and the crew hoped he'd get the others—Osiris, Zavala, even the Speaker—to see what we saw. The City was a refuge, yeah, but if we hid too long, let all we'd lost get picked apart by pirates and warmongers, we'd lose our humanity.\n\nJust like we lost Andal."

Though we'd get our cut.\n\nIn hindsight, we were waaay too ambitious.\n\nDidn't see it in that light at the time. But, then again, you never do.\n\nWhen Andal joined the Vanguard, he was our inside man. It was a sweet deal—he would drop intel on new stashes or Fallen movements, and Shiro and I would jump the gun, hit 'em first, claim what we could, deliver the rest to the City.\n\nMaybe we skimmed a little off the top—nothing excessive, just a \"finder's fee.\"\n\nProbably shouldn't be putting all this out there for anyone to judge… What's the statute of limitations on misspent youth? Whatever… Long time ago. But it speaks to what I'm getting at…\n\nI always tried to do right, even if I occasionally got sidetracked. Andal joining the Vanguard was a gift in some ways, a bummer in others. More importantly…\n\nHe'd made a deal, given his word—to me and to himself—when he took the Dare.\n\nI won, he lost.\n\nSo he left the road. Joined the bigwigs up in the Vanguard. And he reminded me of a lesson I've always known, but every now and then would forget…\n\nYou give your word, you keep it.\n\nBut the longer Andal was up in that Tower, \"caged\"—my word, never his—the more he saw things \"the Vanguard way.\" Looking back, he was only ever doing the right thing. Seeing him change and, in truth, grow as a Guardian and as a person…\n\nI've never admitted this, but… I thought less of him. My best friend, my closest ally—all because he'd stuck to his word. Accepted the Dare, and even when he came up on the bad end, he never wavered from doing exactly what he said he'd do…\n\nJoin the damn Vanguard.

I can feel myself trying to talk around what I want to say, fill it with the ol' poop and circumstance. I'm trying, though. Fighting my… better angels, to get to what I need to say.

Our Dare.\n\nThe Hunters' Dare.\n\nIt's a stupid thing.\n\nBut it's an honor thing.\n\nAnd it cost me my friend—I cost me my friend.\n\nBut before the Dare, we had Taniks. Hell… After the Dare we had Taniks. After my Dare we had Taniks. Always comes back to Taniks, don't it?\n\nFor the uninitiated, Taniks is a Fallen mercenary with no House but the House that pays him. Most Fallen won't deal with him. But when a Captain, or an Archon, or a Kell needs something done and their crews ain't cutting it—or, when they want a job done real hush-hush—they call Taniks.\n\nBack in the day, me, Shiro, Andal, and a few others got on radars we'd rather stay off. The Fallen Houses put out bounties. Lotta Glimmer on our heads. Lotta Ether. Taniks took the gig. Only we didn't know. There'd been stories of a renegade Fallen dropping bodies, but nothing ever concrete, so we just brushed them off as more of the same. Nothing we couldn't handle, even on an off day.\n\nI mean, we were all aware the Fallen were dangerous—big-time threat, each day, every day. But a solitary Fallen boogeyman, free of House, cutting down Guardians one by one? Ha, yeah right.\n\nUntil \"yeah right\" was standin' in front of us.\n\nFirst impression… He was a big boy. Bad attitude.\n\nSecond… He was standin' over the body of Nian Ruo. Didn't know her well, but we'd done a few runs. That day was supposed to be an in-and-out'er. But then… Taniks.\n\nNian never got back up, and Shiro's boy Lush lost his Ghost—full-on RTL, returned to Light. Gone and done.\n\nThe whole scene was a blur. Lost our haul and hauled our butts outta there. Still not sure how we lost Taniks and his boys. Just lucky we did.\n\n'Course, ditchin' that troublemaker wasn't the end.\n\nShiro and I got back, filled Andal in on the what-went-down soon as we found him. This was before his Vanguard days. He'd been running a second grab on a cache out west. Wasn't back till the next night.\n\nWe told him about Nian. Lush was freaking out about his Ghost. Couldn't blame him. Still can't.\n\nThen we did the dumb thing.\n\nWe got cocky."

Don't laugh. I didn't. He was a great guy, even if his humor was… a bit… \"forced\" seems like a nice way to put it. But he wasn't wrong.\n\nLush wanted to join up—a little payback for his little Light—but we nixed that. Loved the kid, but no Ghost meant no way. Poor fella died his final death, RTL, less than a cycle later; went on a run solo, didn't tell anyone, never came back. Shiro used to spin stories about him—still does. Like he's still out there, living a life we only dream of—traveling unknown roads, digging up untold treasures.\n\nMy favorite's the one about the Rat King—how Lush joins up with a folktale, and together they fight the wars we don't see. It's just fantasy, but I like it. It's the kind of bedtime story I used to tell Ace as he was fighting off sleep, when he was here.\n\nBut he's not here.\n\nNeither is Lush.\n\nNeither is Andal.\n\nAnd someday, neither will I.\n\nDidn't have a Hunter Vanguard back then, what with Kauko Swiftriver finally being declared dead after two years MIA and his Dare nowhere to be found.

Smartest guy I've ever known, but maybe he wasn't, ya know? \"For granite.\" Heh. Almost as dumb as his catchphrases.\n\nCome on, Cayde. Stay on target…\n\nEach new day. Helluva thing. Embrace it. Enjoy it. But never forget…\n\nIt's a hard life.\n\nAnd when friends fall. When brothers fade. When your Queen… When…\n\nWhen we lose the things that matter… Well, a lotta people can use that—own it. That pain. That loss. They find a way to motivate—to celebrate.\n\nFor all my charms, seeing the good in the gone ain't one.\n\nAnd my Queen helps me through that. Because I believe she was something special. She was good. She had to be. And I… Yeah, I do. So damn much.\n\nWhen the others I've lost along the way start to weigh me down, I think of her, and she just overwrites everything else.\n\nThat's how strong her pull is. That's how big the hole she left is… Massive. It devours.\n\nShe swallows all other bad things. Not sure it's healthy, the way I deal with loss. But it's my way. It's what works for me. And it makes me happy. Thinking of her…\n\nMakes. Me. Happy.\n\nAnd the loss fades away."

And that thing is… loss. Losing. I'm a poor loser, I admit it. I run from it. Full speed. Others don't. Others accept it. But everything I said about my Queen is true; she is my shield.\n\nShe is also a lie.\n\nI don't know when I made her up. Or better… I don't know when I decided to believe in a life I don't know and can never truly own. Was it during this life? Was my rebirth as a Guardian—or the void of everything I was before—what drove me to invent comfort? Possible. Even likely. But I'm not sure.\n\nI do have flashes of memory of the life I had before I was a Guardian, but that's all they are, flashes—quick flickers of people and places in my dreams or in that space between a bullet and getting rezzed.\n\nI see a woman there, and she's all I've ever known of a life long since gone. I feel love for her. Is that love a memory, or am I simply loving the memory? I've convinced myself of the former. I've concocted a truth to make myself whole.\n\nThe kid. The woman. I do not know them. They are not real.\n\nBut I wish I did. And I wish they were.\n\nThey're just the two best cards I could find to keep up my sleeve when the odds were stacked against me.\n\nI made them real in my mind and in my heart.\n\nI fell in love with the idea of them, and I crafted a truth that allowed me to feel.\n\nIn truth, it was selfish.\n\nWhen I came to for the first time, I felt so alone. Broken. My Ghost tried to comfort me. But this life felt hollow. So I ran.\n\nBut the flashes… Like daydreams, they promised something more. Something other than suffering and war. So I clung to them. And I built my truth. And it made me a better man.\n\nSome would dispute that fact. Some would say, \"A good man who lies to himself is good only because he hides from the truth.\" But I disagree. I think, in this world, you need to find what is best in you and cling to it. That's all I did. I found what moved me, and I fought for it.\n\nWithout Ace, and without my Queen to listen to me, to hear me, to see me… there's no telling who I would've become.\n\nBut I know.\n\nAnd I know there's a chance it wouldn't have been very nice.\n\nSo that's what I am offering to you here: a chance. Look at my life. Look at the things I've said, the things I've done. See how the promise of a simpler life and true, pure love—even if it was all just a game—see how it drove me, directed me…\n\nNow go find your own.\n\nI know this confession isn't as clean as you may like, but then again…\n\nIt's not a confession.\n\nIt's a warning.\n\nFind the path to your best self and walk it. Because the alternative is a lonely road. Don't you ever forget it.\n\nOtherwise, I may just have to come back.\n\nAnd kick your ass.\n\nSee ya later, pal.\n\n—Cayde-6"

There are places even the Traveler's Light cannot reach.\n\nNow, here I am, lost in the shadowy pastiche known as the Reef. And not a single tether of Light touches me. But that… that is what my Guardian wanted.\n\nHis name is Cyrell; and Cyrell called me Strain. I found him on the far edges of Mercury, in a valley that the Vex transformation had never reached. He seemed resilient, unwavering, old, and wise. I'd searched so long for my better half that I didn't hesitate. If I had considered but one moment more, I might have sensed how tired and burdened and tangled his soul truly was, and I would have left him in peace. And I would not be a murderer of my kin.\n\nCyrell told me we came to the Reef in search of Awoken. He had heard stories of how this far-flung offshoot of Humanity had returned to Sol with unparalleled knowledge. He believed they had the answer to a question he refused to share. I know now, however, that he really came here to spare me.\n\nHe confessed he could not bear another battle nor fight in the name of something no one could possibly understand. Though he could not remember his past, he knew deep down that he had already fought his last war.\n\nHe couldn't kill me. I was his friend. He doesn't kill friends. He wouldn't kill himself, either; that was cowardly, weak. And if the Ghosts' sole purpose was to raise the dead to kill in the name of unexplainable forces, he could no longer let that happen. He would end the cycle. He would spare his brothers- and sisters-in-arms. He would let the dead rest.\n\nYears later, I saw Cyrell again, clad in wretched-looking armor, dragging a chain of dead Ghosts in the name of peace. Still searching for an Awoken who could answer the one question that has haunted him since his rebirth.\n\nIf you are a Ghost who has not yet found your Chosen, let this be a warning: Cyrell, the Ghost Hunter, will end your search for you. If you are Awoken and perchance have the answer he seeks, please, do not keep your secrets from him.\n\nYour life depends on it."

That praise emboldened him; he grew expectant, addicted to their exaltations and gifts.\n\nThe more he consumed, the more the village's resources dwindled. He led expeditions to take from others—no warning, no diplomacy. He showed his might as one of the Risen and demanded he be lauded as savior. Those he once protected now died under his charge, and they venerated him all the more for it.\n\nAs much as she tried to guide him back into the Light and remind him why he was Chosen, he could not hear her over the adulations of his newfound vassals. Resurrection after resurrection, his legend flourished while the dead remained dead; he grew ever more covetous and unforgiving. He stopped learning from his losses and came to feel entitled to his immortality.\n\nOne winter night, clad in golden armor, he made war on a seaside settlement of fishers and spiritualists. Not a man, woman, or child survived. Flushed with the high of easy victory, he and his followers were ill prepared for the Fallen war party that had been stalking them the last few moons. It was a massacre atop a massacre. And only he, one of the Risen, would walk away from this.\n\nShe looks away from the human carnage surrounding her. Looks down upon the one she chose.

We didn't want to go.\n\nThen there I was, separated from the whole. I could feel it shrink, slip back into itself, dim and unseeing. I knew it was waiting. Resting. Watching. Considering.\n\nAnd I knew what I needed to do. Somewhere in this wide, amazing galaxy there was a person. They were quiet and dead, like We had been, but I could bring them back.

Osiris and Ikora would talk for hours—days, sometimes—and frankly, it was pretty boring. Especially when I got stuck entertaining Ophiuchus. Seriously, that Ghost is not a conversationalist.\n\nAnyway, O said he had a theory why there was one Ghost for one Guardian. He thought that each of us had strengths that complemented weaknesses in our Guardian, and vice versa. That we needed to be together, or neither of us would be whole.\n\n\"Like soul mates?\" I asked. \"Because I'm not in love with Osiris or anything. Not only would that be really weird, he kinda gets on my nerves a lot of the time.\"\n\n\"It is not a romantic attachment,\" O said. If he had eyes, he would have rolled them at me. \"It is my belief that the Traveler understood that normal people would not be enough to protect humanity. That it would take those who are extraordinary in both body and spirit. And that only by the merging of Ghost and Guardian into a single unit could this be accomplished.\"\n\n\"I don't know where Ikora keeps you,\" I told him, \"but Osiris and I are not 'a single unit.' You've heard us argue. A lot.\"\n\n\"And why do you challenge him?\" O asked.\n\n\"Because no one else will. He's the great and powerful Osiris: hero, scholar, savior, yadda yadda. And no one, I mean no one, not even Ikora, really challenges him. They do what he wants, even if it's a terrible idea. Not me.\n\n\"Everyone needs someone to tell them to get over themselves once in a while. Especially Osiris.\"\n\n\"Would you say that is a strength that complements a weakness?\"\n\nI didn't answer. I hate it when someone else is right. Good thing it doesn't happen often.\n\n\"All right then, smarty Ghost,\" I finally said. \"What about you and Ikora? You're both rigid and stuffy, read too much…\"\n\n\"I am a calming influence. I encourage her to think before she acts and not to let her emotions get the best of her.\"\n\nI couldn't help it. I cracked up. It actually took me a minute to get under control. \"Ikora?\" I said, laughing so hard I could barely talk. \"Have you met Ikora?

He boarded the derelict Almighty with his fireteam, hoping to salvage Cabal secrets from the star murderer.\n\nI should have seen the trap. Was it Cabal? Was it some Vex infection from Mercury? I don't know. It's all my fault. I remember how the moment of activation felt like falling. He lunged for the center, crying out to his friends, \"I'll disarm it!\"\n\nHe is still lunging. Fly to the Almighty and you will find him there, caught in the amber of slow time, reaching forever. I have observed his motions carefully. He will arrive at the mechanism and deactivate the trap in only a little more than fifty thousand years.\n\nI cannot resurrect him. I have tried so hard. The City's Warlocks and thanatonauts answered all my desperate questions, even when I began to ask if he could be destroyed.

If a Guardian falls into Titan's methane sea, they do not die instantly, but we can still bring them back on the arcology. If a Guardian hurls themself off their ship into space, do we need to wait for them to disintegrate in the solar wind before we bring them back? No. No. It was never hard before! I see him right there, and he seems so close! All I was ever meant to be was his Ghost!\n\nBut all Ghosts know there are places where we cannot bring our Guardians back to life. And this is one of them. Why? Is the Darkness gathered against us here? Is the Light too weak?\n\nI think I know why. Some share my theory. What do we do when we bring our Guardians back? What is the magical heart of the process? Are we like the City's probability kilns, twisting the quantum vacuum in our favor to yield matter?\n\nPerhaps. Perhaps. But certain members of a cult I shall not directly name have their own specific interpretation of this process. \"When you bring him back,\" they told me, \"you must have a template… an image to provide you with the information you need. Where do you find that template?\n\n\"Simply in a neighboring timeline. A place where he is still alive and intact. And wherever there is great danger, wherever the probability of death is too high, then those timelines become scarce and hard to reach. And so you find the zones where Guardians cannot easily be remade.\"\n\nIf this is true, then I am doomed and free. There will be no alternate worlds in which my Guardian escapes that trap. There will be no hope of resurrection.\n\nI will be a Ghost alone.\n\nBut the thought haunts me that I might be wrong, and that he is still waiting for me…"

The few survivors were huddled close in the dark of a cave, muffling their heavy, quick breaths, stifling their sobbing.\n\nWhen I found them, many nights before, I also found renewed purpose. I had traveled these dead and dying worlds for longer than I cared to remember, all the while in search of a spark worthy of ignition.\n\nOver time I'd grown weary, but in this small band of survivors, I found hope. If I couldn't find a lost soul worthy to be touched by the Light, then I would find another way, a smaller way, to be of service. I would lead this small gathering of desperate men, women, and a single child to the growing sanctuary beneath the Traveler.\n\nIf I could not find a hero to challenge the Darkness, I would be a guide to those in need of salvation.\n\nIt took some time to gain their trust. I was odd—other. They thought I was an angel. I told them I was not. They named me Tiānshǐ. I did not object.\n\nThe child marveled at me. Still too young to speak, much less comprehend, he had a presence that was a burden and a boon. His parents did all they could to nurture him, protect him with the aid, comfort, and care of their traveling companions—once strangers, now bound deeper than blood by their shared experience in this new life after the end of the world.\n\nOn that day, in that cave, huddled in fear as the Fallen Skiff's roar faded over the tree line, the mother wailed—a sound I had never before heard and hope never to hear again.\n\nSuch pain. Such sorrow.\n\nGrief. Suffering. Loss.\n\nHer cry echoed through the forest. Her husband, weeping and on the edge of breaking down, simply held her.\n\nAnd the dead child in her arms.\n\nThe others tried to calm them, out of fear that the Fallen would return. The attack had been swift and brutal. Twenty dead. Only nine survivors, here, in this cave. I watched the tree line, anxious and afraid.\n\nThe mother's pain filled the space between the thick trees. I turned back to her and saw it for the first time: the child's spark.\n\nFaint. But there.\n\nThis little boy was not my charge. Those selected to return were champions. This child was so small, so frail. What devotion had he shown? What bravery? What had he sacrificed? But a thought lingered…\n\nWas it not my purest purpose to deliver hope? Every hero raised fought not for themselves but for the whole of humanity. If saving one life—if redressing this one terrible loss—was not a worthy cause… what was?\n\nI watched the mother as she cried.\n\nI felt myself expand. Felt the Light that was me intensify. In a way, it was outside of my control, as if something had reached inside of me and flipped a switch. A beam erupted from my core and bathed with Light the child's small, broken body.\n\nA second passed—\n\nAnd he began to cry. All fell silent. The Traveler's gift had been given. A child, returned. And with him, the beginning of my journey's end.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Would the child grow to reach his peak physical self? Would he, like all returned, be ready for the wars to come?\n\nBut then a thought came over me, one I had never before considered: maybe death would have been better.\n\nHad I saved the child, or doomed him?\n\nAs his cries echoed, the survivors looked on in shock. There was joy in their silence—wonder.\n\nI looked down on him, and pride began to well inside of me. I had done what was right.\n\nBut that was then—only months ago, but long enough to seem a lifetime.\n\nNow the Fallen are back, and we are running.

But I had to do what I had to do. Some risks, after all, are worth taking. It was now or never. And besides, there's no timing like bad timing.\n\nI opened myself up to the Traveler's gift and enveloped her in Light just as the mining rig settled.\n\nMy new Guardian gasped and sat up, crying out as if waking from a nightmare.\n\nNot good.\n\nThe Cabal security team was on us quick. Their slug shots rang out.\n\nBefore she could take a second breath, my Guardian was dead… again.\n\nI spun and hit her with another scan as the rig warmed its burners.\n\nThe Cabal released their War Beasts on us.\n\nMy Guardian was up as the ground heated and the War Beasts charged.

Instinct, as it turns out, is a compelling motivator. She was up in a flash, sprinting away from the rig's burners and away from the gnashing teeth that were quick on her heels. As soon as she cleared the rig, the Cabal opened fire. And here's where risk became reward…\n\nMy Guardian didn't flinch. Didn't cower. Instead, she got angry. And aggressive.\n\nThis long-dead woman was back among the living for only a moment, and already she was one with war. I wonder, perhaps, if that's what makes humanity the perfect weapon—if that's what makes it a force worthy of concern. Not my place to say. Though what came next gave me pause and more than a hint of pride.\n\nMy Guardian charged the nearest Cabal—a creature of war she had never seen, a hulking brute in thick-plated armor.\n\nShe docked and dodged, left to right and back again to avoid slug fire. A War Beast lunged, clamping its jaw on my Guardian's forearm. She yelled.\n\nThe Cabal laughed. The other War Beasts closed in.\n\nThen…\n\nMy Guardian—this woman only just reborn in the Light—grabbed the Beast clamping down on her arm by the hind legs, Lifted, and brought her entire weight down on the creature's spine, knee first.\n\nThe sound—cracked bone and a sudden, sharp yelp—caused the other Beasts to halt and the Cabal to quell their laughter.\n\nShe resumed her charge. No hesitation. The Beast's limp body was still locked on her arm. She pulled it free—I could hear the flesh tear, but she did not flinch. Instead she closed the distance, rushing the Cabal, the Beast held tight in her good arm's grip.\n\nThe Cabal raised his weapon, but too late. The other Beasts charged as my Guardian pummeled the Legionary with the corpse of his pet. It was brutal, swift.\n\nI issued a warning as the War Beasts lunged, but it didn't matter—she already had the Cabal's slug thrower in hand. What followed… I am reluctant to recount in full.\n\nShe was new then—awakened into a world of sudden, fierce violence.\n\nAll I will say is that I am here, and my Guardian is near, and somewhere deep within the EDZ there is ground still darkened with the stain of Cabal blood.\n\n—Tam, a Ghost recounting his Guardian's resurrection"

Instead, it is their courage, their strength, their humanity that has been, in truth, the greatest gift—their greatest weapon.\n\nThis thought brings me joy and a bit of peace amid so much chaos, and I find myself asking, often and with great anticipation:\n\nWhere to next?\n\n—Observations of a Ghost named Kaiser on Guardian inspiration"

        "text": "Out here in the wilds, survival depends heavily on your ability to elude Fallen patrols. Everything else, every other danger, is secondary. Exposure. Starvation. Hungry beasts. Crazed bandits. All can be assessed and managed. But Fallen—these vicious pirates—they hunt and kill not only for their own survival… but for sport. They relish the slaughter.\n\nI was guiding our ragtag group through dense woods, but with a child to carry and many survivors wounded, we didn't move quickly enough. We'd been spotted a few miles back. The attack was swift, violent. The child's mother fell almost immediately. His father foolishly—though maybe it's best to imagine he was brave—let his grief and fear get the better of him. He ran to her aid, but there was none to give. Now he is gone as well. Two parents dead. One orphaned child gifted in ways he can't yet understand.\n\nOthers grabbed the infant and fled. He cried—confused, frightened. They muzzled his fear and made for the thick of the forest. I followed. The child was mine to protect—if I could. I had no choice but to stay with him.\n\nAnd yet, here I am…\n\nThis hasty dictation is meant to give some insight, if needed, into my choice—into my moment of weakness that led to a child reborn. I'm recounting as I flee, so mind the clipped nature, this truncated plea for understanding and a brief history of what happened here.\n\nI will send this message on signal to any Ghost who may hear. The Fallen are on me. I have run from the pack to lead them away. Should I survive, I will return to the child. Should I fall, he will be left to others to raise—and will ever have only the one, second, life to give.\n\nI left him in the care of a terrified man and woman. But they are smart and caring; they have courage but know when to run, when to survive. They will stay hidden until the Fallen are away, my Light serving as a distraction to lure them as far from these Humans as I can.\n\nI made my presence known to the pirates and darted from the last of the survivors—made myself a target to buy them time. But that time is short.\n\nThe Fallen are close now. And closing. I can hear the bark of their war cries. I can feel the spark of their blades. They've long since learned that to kill one like me is a future problem solved.\n\nI am not sorry for the choice I made. The child gave hope, though fleeting. What comes next for him is unknown. But there is promise in him, should he find sanctuary. Should he find guidance.\n\nThis is not a confession. This is my hope. This is my—\n\n—Fragment of the last transmission from an unknown Ghost"

Over time he… distanced himself—stood out.\n\nIt took some time for her to adjust to his personality. From what she's shared, it took him time as well. The Cayde-6 known to all is not the man he was in total. His wit and his playfulness were a shield—a weapon as trained as his blade or his hand cannons.\n\nHe called her Sundance. I was never sure why. She said it was from an old legend—a fable from the time before the time before. I always thought it was because of her spark, the grace with which she moved—so effortless, so sly. They were a perfect match.\n\nThere's no doubt he recounted his return to those closest to him on more than one occasion; and there's no doubt as well that the events shifted a bit with each telling. Like his wit, the building of his legend was a weapon.\n\nFor those who don't know… For those who were not lucky enough to hear the tale of Cayde-6's first from his own mouth—with that charm and the way he'd act out his favorite parts, complete with sound effects—here is one telling…\n\nIt's a recording from cycles past. It's not the whole story, but where Cayde-6 was involved, nothing ever was…\n\n\"BOOM! I wake up. Groggy. Confused. Hungover. It's the same for us all, so that initial shock's nothing new. Sundance is in my face, and I'm freaking out. My brain works, but I don't remember a thing 'cept that I seem to be a functioning life form—I'm human, I'm a man. And then my mind starts reeling a thousand miles a minute. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. Like I'm downloading the 'Idiot's Guide to Basic Human Existence.' Cool. Great. Still can't remember anything. And I sure can't wrap my head around the talking, floating magic robot orb-thing jabbering in my face. I'm freaked. So, I freaked. Smacked her to the ground. Hard… And I ran.\n\n\"I'm runnin'. She's runnin'… Or, ya know, whatever she's doin' since she doesn't have any legs… She's right behind me, going, 'Wrong way! Wrong way!' She's screaming. I'm screaming. Whatever she's yelling, I just keep running. It's night. Did I mention that? It's nighttime and my eyes are still adjusting. So, I'm runnin', I'm runnin'. Can't see. Can't remember. Scared to death. Confused as all get-out. And then—\n\n\"I fall. I'm straight up falling. Just like that, I ran… Right. Off. A. Cliff. It wasn't a short drop. I bounced… so many times. Felt each and every one. Till I didn't. Till it all went black again. And then…\n\n\"BOOM! I'm back! She got me right up on my feet. Just like she always does. And that, my dudes, was the start of a beautiful friendship.\"\n\nMost haven't heard that story, and in listening, you hopefully weren't looking for any definitive truth of who he was as a man or a Guardian. That's not what the story's for. Its purpose, now more than ever, fits nicely into the armor Cayde wore best…\n\nHe thought it was funny. And now, more than ever…\n\nCayde would want us to laugh.\n\n—Shiro-4's Ghost, at a gathering in Cayde-6's honor"

        "text": "I am quiet, I am not here, the Fallen cannot see me, they cannot know me. I am not a shadow, but I move among them, silent, deliberate of motion, and intent as when I entered their hollow one month prior. I used the light of day to mask my own, because the forest here is barren, it's, it's, it's a dead place, to and fro, a constant buzz as the scavengers go about the business of stripping this world of its old glories. And I watch, I learn, I record and preserve; their every movement is my obsession. I hang on their every word, even though I am not versed in their nightmare tongue, but others are and they will decipher it; they will find the secrets hidden within. Secrets are like weapons, and I am an instrument of their unmaking. They are enemy, they are cruel, and I will learn and share, and they will be undone.\n\nWhat is that shouting? I am deep now, no telling how far in. I have tracked each meter. Mapped every path. But this maze is ever-winding and their cheers now echo, violent with joy, and I hesitate to investigate as I am entering unknown corridors thick with security… Yes, yes, this is a special place, a holy place, a mechanized place, and the shouts merge with screams and the grinding of gears, and the joy joins with pain. There is suffering here, punishment—a, a… a ritual? I must know so we may know, and I move slow, careful… must… not… be seen… cannot be detected… Meter by meter, anywhere where cover is provided. Quick and with purpose whenever exposed. I make my way, leaving other avenues unexplored; the cheers must be understood. But eventually they die. Replaced by the harmony of the pirates' busy days and nights, oh my how they never rest—or rather… when they rest, others continue the work, prepping scavenger sorties, sifting through spoils, readying their fleet, their weapons, their worship. The manner in which they revere machines, I should feel safe here, I should be among their gods… Am I machine? I don't know, I don't know anything. Their worship is not so simple. With the cacophony of excitement no longer echoing, I slow my pace but remain vigilant in my efforts to locate its origin.\n\nIt is weeks before I do, weeks before now. A ceremony has just ended and I am sending out a recollection of what I have seen, because I am seen—these are my final moments, of this I am sure. The ceremony is combat, ritual, and fury, it is a pit and arena where the lesser and unworthy must prove their value or suffer and die. Oh how they fight dirty, oh how they fight to survive—or to thrive. In this pit, before the eyes of an Archon, shamed Eliksni may redeem themselves, lesser pirates may improve their station: a Dreg to a Vandal, a Vandal to a Captain, a Captain to… This is their forge, their place of judgment, their trial before their betters. This is what we are up against; kill or die, thrive or perish, they have no use for the weak and they watch and cheer and scream as their Archon looks on. But I have become careless. The fervor became a distraction and now the Archon's eyes have found me and I am too deep to run and I think he is smiling…\n\n—The last frantic transmissions of Wren, a brave Ghost of the spectral network"

The Traveler is our primary, our mother, the primordial and the pinnacle. A dear friend, the Ghost of Pujari, once compared the Traveler to a song that has never been sung—\n\nPEACH: Look, the answer no one likes to give is that no one knows what the Traveler is or anything about it. Not even us.\n\nBALTHAZAR: We know she wished for us to raise Guardians to be her avatars and defenders—\n\nPEACH: Do we, though? Just because we CAN do that doesn't mean we were MADE to do that. And who says it's a \"she\" anyway? Why does \"it\" need a gender?\n\nBALTHAZAR: The Traveler, in her omniscient wisdom, looked into the past and the future, and from all the generations that emerged from the cradle of Earth, she chose the best of them to be her champions. Each Ghost was lovingly and carefully created for their one true Guardian. The Ghost and Guardian complete each other.\n\nPEACH: If that's true, then the Traveler's kind of a jerk.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Excuse me?\n\nPEACH: Look, I know tons of Ghosts who died before they ever found their Guardians. I know some Ghosts who still haven't found a Guardian. You haven't. And I haven't, but I don't think I'm \"incomplete\" because of it.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I have the humility to recognize my own shortcomings and to submit myself to the Traveler's plan.\n\n\nQ: Do you remember being inside the Traveler?\n\nPEACH: No.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I do. We call it the Womb.\n\nPEACH: I have never and will never call it that.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Imagine a cosmos inside a bottle. Trillions of stars orbiting each other in a complex weave. But they aren't stars. Perhaps a better word would be… souls. Souls, dancing in an infinite space enclosed within a celestial egg.\n\nPEACH: Which is it, an egg or a womb?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It's called a metaphor.\n\nPEACH: Well then, pick a metaphor. Not twelve.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Well, what would you call it?\n\nPEACH: I wouldn't call it anything, because I don't remember it, and I don't think you do either.\n\n\nQ: Some people say that each Ghost is an aspect of the Traveler—that is to say, that each Ghost represents a part of the divine Whole.\n\nPEACH: [loud laughter]\n\nBALTHAZAR: Would you please? This is unbecoming.\n\nPEACH: First of all, that wasn't a question. Second of all… [more laughter] Third of all: if I'm a part of the Traveler's brain or soul or whatever, then the Traveler sure isn't divine, I'll tell you that much.\n\n\nQ: What will you do if you never find a Guardian?\n\nBALTHAZAR: I shall find a Guardian. The Traveler has willed it so.\n\nPEACH: Did you get that in writing?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It is true that some Ghosts die before finding their partners. If that happens to me, then I suppose I will \"do\" nothing, since I will no longer be. But I have faith.\n\nPEACH: If I never find my Guardian, I'll go steal someone else's. I hear Sagira had a good time with that.\n\n\nQ: If you could eat, what would you eat first?\n\nPEACH: Finally, a good question!\n\nBALTHAZAR: We do not know the desire for food. Our semicorporeal form—\n\nPEACH: Nectarines. Or hot sauce. Ooh, or crickets. Crunchy roasted crickets. Crunchy food sounds so fun. I wish I could get cricket carapace stuck between my teeth. Here's a question for YOU: what's it like to have teeth?\n\nBALTHAZAR: Is this over yet?"

Another of my little pack has found her partner, a Human male, and now the two of them are coming to you by watercraft over the Pacific. Keep an eye on this one, Tallu. He has taken the name Andal Brask, and I believe he will be trouble.\n\nPerhaps all this travel has made me sentimental, for when one of my Ghost wards finds their Guardian, I am sad, because my pack grows smaller. I miss them when they are gone. Now I am down to one Ghost other than my own. Pup, we call him. The runt of my metallic litter. Pup has yet to speak, but always his little blue eye searches for his Guardian.\n\nI plan to resupply at the Cosmodrome and then take Pup north. Those steppes are uncharted territory, except by that lone wolf, Conar. My correspondence with him is regular in the outbound direction; I consider myself lucky when he answers every fifth message. Still, you and I both know his intel is good. No one else knows Old Russia like he does.\n\nPerhaps in the Cosmodrome I will find a ship capable of breaking atmosphere. Though there is much of this Earth I have yet to see, I have come across more than a few Ghosts who believe their Guardians are offworld, waiting in the Golden Age ruins of Freehold and Ishtar and beyond. Some of these little Lights have decided to brave the null on their own to reach their fated partners. I tell them there's still so much of Earth we've yet to sniff out, that perhaps their Guardians have not yet been born, but some of them are convinced. If my next Ghost pack wants to make the journey, I am determined to join them.\n\nThese last few months we've enjoyed the pleasant absence of Cyrell. Now I feel more confident that we lost him in Australis. If he tries to hurt my Ghosts, I will rip his throat out.\n\nI hope you're not feeling too cooped up. You're still doing good work, Tallu.

And then I see it: a burnt-out building, the only man-made structure for miles. I do not know whether to fly faster or keep a stately pace. It doesn't matter. The dead cannot see.\n\nI am nervous. Why am I nervous?\n\nAs I draw closer, I rehearse what I might say. First introductions are important. \"You are a child of the Traveler's Light,\" I say to myself. \"You have been chosen in defense of this solar system… No. No. Hm. You… We are both children of the Traveler. You and I are both children of…\"\n\nI forget my words as I slip into the building. I find meteorological equipment. I find an empty office. I find a dingy breakroom. At the back of the breakroom, I see my other half: a Fallen Vandal crushed beneath a toppled refrigerator.\n\nI am devastated. I have seen the Fallen. They are butchers. Castaway murderers. I would take anyone, but not this. Not this thing.\n\nI turn away. I count seventeen slow laps around the room and then another four around the building. I should be decisive, shouldn't I? I should be filled with pride that I have fulfilled my first purpose. I am not. It doesn't matter. I cannot ignore the pull.\n\nI return to the breakroom. I do not know what I will say, but—Fallen or no—it is the Traveler's will that I do this. I reach toward the Light, then reach toward that pull to join them together.\n\nThe refrigerator trembles as the Light suffuses him. I hear a low groan. \"Push it away,\" I whisper. If my Risen dies beneath this refrigerator and I fly away into the sun, no one will know. Perhaps I will have done the Earth a great service. \"I'm here with you, but you must help yourself. Push it away and sit up.\"\n\nThe refrigerator shifts, then topples to the side. An Awoken man sits up and pushes the dead Vandal off his chest like an unwelcome blanket on a hot summer night. With effort, he wiggles free and stands straight.\n\n\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asks. He looks around, then down at his blue hands. \"What am I?\"\n\n\"I am your Ghost,\" I say with more than a hint of obvious relief. \"You are one of the Traveler's Chosen, a defender of humanity. What is your name?\"\n\nHe flexes his fingers, works his jaw, blows a raspberry. Then he looks at me. \"Savin. Yes, I think I call myself Savin.\" He nods, satisfied. \"Let's go, Yourghost.\""

No, not in the end. Much sooner.\n\nThe flaw in his ambition became evident shortly after we crossed the western mire. At first I took his flights of fancy as playful enthusiasm—frivolous aggression free of consequence, a means of honing his focus and skill in advance of the dangers to come. But quickly, oh, so quickly, I found his mind was not in tune with reality. He was driven—pulled?—by his imagination.\n\nWhere any other would see the crippled ruins of an old-world crane—the snapped length of its long arm creaking in the breeze—he would see a demon, and in the cutting shrill of the swaying metal's cry he would hear a monster's ravenous shriek.\n\nHe had long talked of the adventures of his life past. \"I am an anomaly,\" he would decree, \"The lone Guardian whose past rings true, whose history is his guide.\"\n\nHe spoke about that dead life with such passion, in such detail, I not only wanted to believe… I did.\n\nBut as he charged the crane's age-poked carcass, I knew a truth that had haunted me since the carving of the Wicked Wood, some months gone: he was broken. His mind—unsettled. His truths—unfettered by fact, unbound by reality.\n\nHe had named the Wood, as he had the Howling Hills, the Dead Man's Crevasse, the Gorgon's Maze. All mundane landscapes marked as hazards to be conquered, enemies to be slain, as he weaved a mythic tale of his own grand—and as I would find, delusional—design.\n\nIn the Hills, he slaughtered wolves; he called them Hounds of Hell. In the Crevasse, he burned the remains of long-dead \"survivors\"; he called them Foot Soldiers of the Necro-King. Down in the Maze, he covered his tracks so that the Stone Mother would not—could not—follow.\n\nHe did all those things and none, because none of those things were true outside of his fraying mind. The wolves were simply rabid. The bones, no threat beyond a reminder of all we'd lost. The Maze? Just a canyon—one way in, one way out, a straight shot through.\n\nAs the crane fell and my Guardian issued his \"killing blow,\" he laughed and then turned to me. His eyes… I could see he was gone—the one I'd returned all those cycles past replaced by a hollow shell filled with madness.\n\nI do not know what broke him, or if he had ever been whole to begin with, but in that moment, as he spoke—the conquered husk of the Dragon of Summers' End, which wasn't really a dragon but simply a fragile old crane, lying defeated in his wake—I knew I would have to let him go… to end his slide into uncontrolled folly.\n\n\"Panza, old man,\" he started. \"The Dragon is gone, but he yielded his treasure to me in a whisper… A secret so dire it may just save us all.\" He leaned closer and said in a hushed voice, as if sharing a confidence, \"The Traveler is no gift—it is a lie… A beacon for death and destruction. Within be dragons, nurtured by our suffering, weaned on our hope. All dragons must die. The shell must be cracked till its yolk drowns those who worship its deceit. Our last great conquest. The crowning battle of our legend writ large.\" And then he shouted, \"For Light to endure, the Traveler must perish!\"\n\nHe was smiling. Confident. Manic.\n\nTwo days later he took a fall while challenging the Mountain Troll of Gallows Rock. It was a boulder. There was no troll. It crushed him. And though it caused me great pain—still to this day—\n\nI did not return him.

Handle with care.\nThe burden is not yours alone, no matter the burden.\nShould Darkness call, answer true, and it will shrink from the Light.\nWear your confidence with pride, but know it is a tool, not a weapon.\nBe mindful of the joy found in victory—it is earned but should never be the aim.\nFor all you will see, all you discover—never lose the gift of curiosity.\nThe Darkness would bend you to its will, but the Light bends to yours.\nFailure is an opportunity to learn.\nIf the bones talk, do not listen.\nI am your guide and your friend, your ally and your tool. Use me.\nI will never leave you, but should I fall, remain vigilant, remain true.\n\nThis isn't the whole of my life advice, but it's something. We'll add more as we go along.\n\n—An unknown Ghost's life advice for an unknown Guardian"

They gave him a detailed analysis of the Red Legion's fury. The light from the monitors was the only illumination in the room as his arms flew across the controls.\n\nRelaying warnings to Petra and the Awoken. He could already see the remainder of the Awoken fleet disappearing off his scopes, going into hiding.\n\nRelaying warnings to the City, though he could see he was far too late. Their comms were gone. There was no one left to listen.\n\nRelaying warnings to his people. With the end of the Houses, there were so few who would listen. But if he could save even a handful…\n\nWhile his hands worked, his eyes remained fixed on the screens, watching death, destruction, and horror.\n\nIn his role working with the Guardians of the City, he'd pored over the distress signal from the Dantalion Exodus VI. Source GREENRAVEN had sent bursts of analysis to the Tower at least a dozen times since the days of the Taken War. But he'd never expected numbers of this magnitude.\n\nWith the systems of the Last City offline, he had no problem dialing sensors over the Wall. He'd been able to see with clarity the home of Humanity with a resolution where he could make out parks and lakes and marketplaces.\n\nThese same sensors let him watch, grinding the bone in his mechanical fist, as people died. As the Great Machine was yoked, as the Guardians… fell.\n\nScrambling, he alerted the Crows… but something went wrong. The network had fallen dark—each and every Crow offline. All, that is, save for one. Through a garbled image he saw a hand, an Awoken hand, but it almost immediately fell to static. He wanted to care. He wanted to feel something for them. What dominated his thoughts, though—what made a ticking noise emanate deep in his voice synth—was the growing fear that the Queen's plan had failed.\n\nHe sat back in his chair. Thinking.\n\nThe Prison of Elders orbited far enough away from the core Awoken outposts, and thus far enough away from the Cabal's Phalanx, that it might come out of this unscathed. Nonetheless, he initiated lockdown procedures, prepared for the worst.\n\nA comm ping. Confirmation: Petra Venj and the limited forces at her command evacuated what settlements they could and disappeared into the nooks and crannies of the Reef. She would be unable to send help to the Prison.\n\nFirst House Judgment, then House Wolves. Then Kell Mara Sov. Now he could feel the rest of his adopted people slipping away from him.\n\nWith one of his mechanical arms, he crushed the splinter of bone to dust."

Nearby, Petra drummed her fingers along the hilt of her knife; her eyes glinted with envy.\n\nShe held onto this prison as if it was the last thing she could control. Perhaps it was. Between the scattered remnants of the Red Legion and the Scorned Barons running rampant through the Reef, the Awoken had little left to call their own.\n\nThere was little left of the Awoken.\n\nVariks sighed. Only a true Kell understood that survival was not a game of waiting. And Petra Venj, for all her military prowess, was no Kell.\n\n\"In a world without Kells, Dreg strength will breed nothing but chaos.\" Variks whispered to himself the old Rain proverb, wishing for the return of the decisive days of his Queen. His Kell.\n\n\"What did you say?\" Petra asked without looking at him.\n\n\"Chaos,\" he replied. \"These Dregs breed chaos.\"\n\nPetra scoffed. \"They're Fallen. And where there's Fallen, there will inevitably be Guardians.\" She turned on her heel and walked away. \"I leave you to your Judgment, Variks. Locate the hole in which these Scorned Barons cower.\" She stopped. Turned back to him. \"Might want to up your rations. You're looking a bit… gaunt.\"\n\nShe smiled, patted him on the back, and continued on her way.\n\nHe watched her go. If his anatomy allowed for it, he would have smiled in kind. Hers was a heart always in the right place… even if the outcome of her decisions was less than ideal. She did not, however, fully appreciate the threat these \"Scorned\" Barons posed. He had tried to warn her when they were just seven Dregs and a heretical Archon. Now their terror was spreading throughout the Reef with more and more Fallen answering the Barons' anarchistic call.\n\nShe was right about one thing though: He could stand to increase his intake. The thought of it made Variks thirsty for the flow. Like all of his kind since the appearance of the Red Legion, he had been forced to ration his intake. He'd never felt so weak, so close to death. But he would survive as he always had.\n\nVariks knew the time would inevitably come when he would have to survive on his own."

They began with the one thing their people needed to survive: Ether. In a way, the Barons had become heads of a new House, priests in their own rites, and arbiters of their own trials.\n\nThe terror they unleashed had almost grown as powerful as any Kell. These heathens were not Eliksni; they were more \"Fallen\" than any of their brethren. They were everything Judgment had sought to purge before the Whirlwind—and now, they sat rotting deep in the Prison of Elders. Cayde and his \"Six\" had done good by their word.\n\nVariks's staff tapped lightly on the floorplates, and chuckling noises emanated from his throat. He hobbled past their cells as the Servitors hummed to life.\n\nFeeding time.\n\nHe saw hatred in every cell he passed.

She and her crew spread terror and disease with their noxious pikes.\n\nElykris, the Machinist. She used stolen Cabal telemetry and gravity traps to sabotage vessels, relieve them of their cargo, and haul the hulks back to their own shipyard chop shops.\n\nPirrha the Blind, the Ghost of Hellrise Cavern, who haunted the Baron's territory with phantom decoys and ended all trespassers from the shadows.\n\nReksis Vahn, the Godslayer, the Hangman. He had secreted away the Ether stores of his victims and driven the Barons and their followers into a frenzy with that tainted feast.\n\nArakses, the Wit. The Traitor. The Trickster. A mastermind. A liar, thief, and backstabber.\n\nKaniks Two-Finger, the Mad Bomber. The dangers of the Reef had multiplied a hundred-fold with his mines hidden on every rock and dusty corner of the belt.\n\nAnd the most disgusting of them all, Hiraks, the Mindbender. This one found in the Hive a way to infect the minds of the Eliksni.\n\nOnly one was missing.\n\nFikrul. The Heretic. The Fanatic. One Variks once dared to call friend, back when the Archon tended to Kaliks Primes. Before his betrayal. He hoped the Fanatic was dead; Cayde assured that he was.

He had hoped it would give him answers, power, anything. All it did was remind him how far he had fallen.\n\nHe slammed a fist on his console, watching the denizens of the prison claw at their cell walls. No, not nothing. Worse than nothing. Now he had doubt.\n\nHis goal had always ever been a simple one. The banner of House Judgment, the calling to which he had been born. Keep his people together.\n\nWith the Light now streaming across the system and nothing to show for it—no Queen, no Eris or Osiris, and no sign the Great Machine remembered the Eliksni—what was there to look forward to? Base survival. One day after the other. Living just because he still drew breath. And where was the Dreg strength in that? What was the…\n\n\"Variks.\" Petra burst through the comms. \"A Legion Harvester has been intercepted at bearing 189. Capture teams are inbound. Survivors for the arena. Prepare to receive.\"\n\nPetra Venj was all that was left for him here, and despite himself, he nodded at the sound of her voice. He had but one ally left, after all.\n\nHe keyed the comms. \"Yes, yes, yes. Bay 41. Bring them in, will meet team. Will make room for new… guests.\" His vocal synth burbled, needing tuning.\n\n\"Copy that.\" She was gone.\n\nHe picked up his staff from where it leaned against the wall and began the long walk to the bay. Mulling his options, his information. His secrets.\n\nSecrets had protected the House of Judgment. The more knowledge one could obfuscate, the more significant one became. Secrets bred possibility. Secrets bred… sway.\n\nBut Judgment, true Judgment, required hierarchy. And Eliksni hierarchy died with the fall of the Houses. The Guardians had picked them apart, Kell by Kell, Prime by Prime. Now, there was all but nothing left of his culture—only pirates and scavengers and lone wolves like the days before the Edge Wars. No trust, no honor, no way to be… necessary.\n\nYet one final hope among the Eliksni still thrived. Craask, Kell of Kings. The Kings understood Judgment, for together they ended the Edge Wars in their people's golden age. Craask. His last hope to see his dreams of a united Eliksni made manifest. He must make contact.\n\nAnd so he hired a bounty hunter named Groks to find Craask and remind them of their need for one another. Groks is emblematic of all that Variks despises in his people—gluttonous, proud, and in it only for himself. When they spoke, Groks made Variks pay with a litany of insults.\n\nVariks the Slip. Variks the Beggar. Variks the Kell-Maker. But it was all for show. Groks would work; and it came for a mere four bales of Etheric Helix and a promise to keep him free of the Prison of Elders. The deal struck, Groks burst out in hysterical laughter.\n\n\"Ha! Consider job done, Slip!\" Groks spoke in a low form of Eliksni, the only reason Variks employed him. \"You have grown desperate with your 'Kell' gone. Have you not heard?\"\n\nVariks sighed.\n\n\"King Kell is gone, Kell-Maker. Dead at the hands of that insane Archon, Fikrul, and some Awoken vagabond he calls 'Father.' What remains of the Kings huddles now in the dead zones of Earth, under the shadow of the Great Machine's Shard. I expect my four bales in—\"\n\nVariks killed the feed. The last link in the great Eliksni chain was broken. If there were any who called themselves Kell out there, they would not know Variks, Judgment, or the laws that governed the Houses. The scattered children of the Whirlwind were dead.\n\nBut… Fikrul survived Cayde and his Six? Groks was a lot of things, but he was not a liar. If Fikrul was alive and strong enough to kill Craask… And who was this Awoken vagabond of which Groks spoke? His mind reeled. So long as Fikrul lived, the Reef was not safe. He scrambled through his comm channels, searching for the right connection.\n\n\"Master Cayde. Variks requests to meet you regarding your deal with Petra, a job undone.\""

Even with the Spider's blessing to pass, he would have been picked clean and docked two times over.\n\nThe hedonistic sounds of Spider's Palace scraped against him. Shouts of victory and defeat reminded Variks of the worst of the Eliksni. His peoples' inherent need for superiority reduced to gambling for trinkets and gems.\n\nVariks searched the crowd, hunched down low. Just another Vandal. In the corner, the unmistakable crowd that surrounded the Hunter Vanguard when he was outside the City.\n\nHe worked his way through the onlookers to take up position alongside Cayde. The Hunter noticed him, he was sure, but said nothing. Variks, for his part, was silent. Watched as he lost a few thousand Glimmer and a sidearm to one of Spider's bodyguards.\n\nCayde spun a knife in his right hand and sighed dramatically. \"If we're going to talk, you're going to buy me a drink.\"\n\nThey found a quiet place at the end of the room. Cayde settled back in the booth. Waiting.\n\n\"You do great service to Reef, yes?\" Variks worked hard to keep his very recognizable voice down. It would be a shame for his vocal synth to malfunction and blare out across the room now. \"Capture Barons. Criminals. For Awoken. For Petra.\"\n\nCayde took a belt and set the glass down on the table, empty. Something hard around his eyes. Amazing how expressive Exos could be. \"Get to the point, Variks.\"\n\n\"Fikrul. The last Scorned Baron. He lives.\"\n\nCayde's horn cut an arc through the air as he shook his head, twice, definitive. \"Trust me. He's dead. Put a hot one right through here.\" He poked Variks right in the center of his chest.\n\n\"Seen on Earth. I have knowledge. I have information. You know Eliksni have ways. Like Mithrax? Like Taniks?\" The warden realized his error as soon as the name was out of his mouth.\n\n\"Don't you EVER mention the name Taniks around me, got it? Not unless you want to lose your last two real arms. We're done. Get. You're bad luck.\" The Hunter stood, made to leave. Variks reached out and grabbed the Vanguard by the arm with one of his mechanic hands.\n\n\"I am sorry. I spoke poorly. Please. Listen.\"\n\nCayde shrugged off the arm and stood, towering over the Fallen for once.\n\nVariks sat up straighter in the booth. \"Take me to Zavala.\" The Titan Vanguard's name was a punctuated, flowing stutter in his mouth. \"I have information. He will like what I say. You for bringing me to him.\"\n\nCayde blinked. \"You want me to take you to the City? No way, bug. Not in a million…\"\n\nWith a thud, Variks dropped the hand cannon he'd been hiding in his cloak on the table: a dull brown, bristles out the top, Ethertech trigger and muzzle assembly. Cayde's eyebrows went up in surprise.\n\n\"A gift of trust. Memento of the Reef. Upgraded, yes? Very deadly.\"\n\nThe Hunter Vanguard tried to hide his excitement. \"Is. Uh. Is that the last one? I haven't seen one of those in…\"\n\n\"One of the last. Not many left.\" Variks' voice was even, calm.\n\nCayde snatched the weapon from the table. Checked the sights, spun it in his hand for a moment, feeling the weight. Grunted, satisfied. Nodded.\n\n\"Like I said: bad luck. C'mon. You can ride with me.\""

He prepared the two empty cells and ordered extraction Servitors into place, all the while reveling in the thought of the judgment of Fikrul.

It was not unknown that Petra and Cayde-6 had smuggled some unknown high-value prisoner—a humanoid prisoner no less, a first for the Prison of Elders if the rumors were true. But Variks assured anyone with the gumption to ask that his Judgment of the Scorned Barons was a sensitive process to be conducted in private.\n\nPetra herself did not help extinguish the scuttle. She was less than adept at the art of secrecy, and everyone knew it. She responded to any bold queries with a stern, \"It is none of your concern,\" which itself was tantamount to a validation that some version of the rumors was true. If only she'd found joy in her Techeun training; if only she'd learned more from the Queen.\n\nEach time Variks performed his rounds, he asked himself what loyalty—if any—he owed to the prince. And each time, he stopped short when he bore witness to the prince's… ramblings. Today was no different. There Uldren sat, elbows atop knees, staring into the same dark corner of the cell, face concealed by his long, black hair, seemingly communing with nothing.\n\n\"I see now… Yes, that's good, so good.\"\n\nMore listening; more nodding.\n\n\"Then that's what we shall do. And look, Sister, he is already here.\"\n\nUldren fell into silence, visibly relaxing. After a moment, he looked back over his shoulder and through the porthole to meet Variks's eyes.\n\n\"Your Grace,\" Variks burbled.\n\n\"Variks the Loyal.\" Uldren smirked. \"Variks the Spark. Did you have something to say to me, or are you content to play the spying crow?\" And there it was again—that fleeting pass of inky darkness that momentarily snuffs the glow of Uldren's eyes. So Variks said nothing. Whether frozen in terror or simply at a loss for words, he could not say.\n\nUldren leaned in, placed a finger against his lips, and spoke low: \"I have a secret for you, Variks. I know you want to hear it.\"\n\nVariks answered with a single, drawn out, and ever-so-slight nod.\n\n\"Your Kell lives,\" Uldren whispered. He leaned in a little closer and asked the one question Variks had never been able to answer: \"Do you know where your TRUE loyalty lies, Variks?\"\n\nUldren didn't wait for a response. His eyes almost immediately darted over his shoulder, toward the shadowy corner that has become his obsession.\n\n\"Of course we can trust him, dear Sister. He is the most loyal…\""

        "text": "Variks admired his masterpiece, the improvised Servitor chain that would finally reveal the secrets of his fanatical former friend.\n\nUnfortunately, Fikrul refused talk of the past, would speak only of the future. Or of Uldren, his Awoken \"father,\" who snatched him from the edge of death and awakened within him a power never before seen in the Eliksni. A power over death itself. A power to remake their people and thrive in a universe of Light and Dark that had both forsaken them and left them scorned.\n\nVariks knew these feelings all too well. It was here, in the deepest catacombs of the Prison of the Elders, where he thrived, where he worked to rebuild the Eliksni. This was his home now, this workspace where he was free to explore the \"potential\" of the prison's inmates for future leverage. The emerald marrow worm-food of the Hive, the prismatic viruses of the Vex, Psion Flayer wavelengths—each of these secrets had been wrested free within these dank halls, traded among his networks for more secrets, or harnessed into weapons for the Awoken.\n\nBut the secrets of Fikrul's… mutation… eluded him. The power within was obvious. Scattered about the floor was the evidence of its potency—as well as too many nights of failure: wrecked sentry Servitors, dozens of deflated Dregs, all pulled from the upper cellblocks to act as his \"assistants.\" Whatever this cold unnatural cocktail was that coursed through Fikrul, it could not be transferred or ingested like the Ether his people needed to sustain their wretched lives.\n\nVariks was all too ready to give up, send Fikrul into the arena to face Cayde-6, and put an end to the legacy of the Scorned Barons—until one day, during Variks's rounds, Uldren spoke to him unprompted. There was a lucidity in the discarded prince's eyes, a clarity that didn't exist even before he disappeared over Saturn's rings. Uldren gave Variks a… fresh perspective.\n\nAnd so, the chain. It was a dangerous gamble, mingling Fikrul's polluted lifeblood with traditional Ether. These Servitors held seventy percent of Variks's own Ether reserves. If this failed… well, it wouldn't be the first time Variks had risked everything and lost.\n\nVariks pulled the lever.\n\nThe hum of the Servitor chain crescendoed, but all he heard was the lingering echo of Uldren's poisonous question: Do you know where your true loyalty lies, Variks?\n\nBut if it worked—perhaps Fikrul could be cured. Perhaps—if what Variks suspected was true, and Fikrul's corruption was related to the Prince's affliction—Uldren could be cured, too.\n\nVariks had said as much to Petra, but she'd refused to listen.\n\n\"You will not experiment on the Prince.\"\n\n\"Our Prince is ill. To keep him here… hide him from Awoken eyes… not right. Not right.\"\n\n\"I've made my decision, Variks.\"\n\nVariks's fingers flexed. \"Petra, the Loyal,\" he sneered. \"Perhaps the murmurs of Kamala Rior are true, yes?\"\n\nPetra glowered. \"I will handle Uldren. You will not touch him.\"\n\nShe'd turned sharply on her heel and strode out. Variks hadn't seen her since.\n\nHe devoted all his time to the Servitor chain—and to his private thoughts."

        "text": "Variks's experiment succeeded, but not how he expected.\n\nIngestion of the Etheric concoction still resulted in Fallen death; it was not, by any means, a life-sustaining substance. It was, however, a life-GIVING substance. Though the dark Ether lingered like a heavy fog, it also seemed to reach out toward empty vessels. In this case, it found the dead Dregs that littered his floor. It slipped inside the corpses like a slow inhalation, inflating them, stretching them to the point of boils and bursting, pulling them to their feet. The dark Ether gave these lifeless Dregs… new life.\n\nThey seethed. Their breathing was steady, but hard and fast. They rumbled as if volcanoes lived inside their chests. A black fire rose from their skin as they burned this dark Ether like a jet engine burns its fuel. What Variks really saw before him was hate-fueled rage incarnate and the beginning of another Whirlwind. They were no longer just Fallen. Fikrul called them his Scorn.\n\nBehind him, Fikrul laughed and laughed and laughed until—he abruptly stopped. At that exact moment, the Scorn dropped to the floor, dead once more.\n\n\"Your scribes, your Kells, your Houses—they will all soon be forgotten, like the Elders and the Skaith before them,\" Fikrul growled in Variks's precious High Speak of Judgment. This drew Variks closer, face to face through the cell's porthole.\n\nFikrul turned his ear upward, listening. Brought his attention back to Variks. \"Father says…\" The pause hung heavy in the air. \"Father says… You know where your true loyalty lies.\"\n\nThe Fanatic stepped back from the porthole and waited.\n\nLoyalty. True loyalty.\n\nHe expected a memory of Mara to appear in his mind. But instead—\n\nInstead he found himself thinking about the prophecies of House Rain.\n\nKell of Kells.\n\nDays later, Variks performed his duties for the last time. He visited central control. Ran a test sim on the security systems, made some adjustments based on the results. Revised and signed off on the daily roster rotations. Finally, he had a private conversation with the prison's sole remaining High Servitor: The Prison of Elders would not go without a warden.\n\nHe did not speak to Petra.\n\nBy the end of that day, the Prison of Elders descended into chaos.\n\n\"Your time WILL come, Variks.\"\n\nUldren sits in his favorite spot, gazing in his favorite direction. \"She told me so. She has but one last wish of you.\"\n\n\"No, your grace.\" Variks' voice was gravelly with emotion. \"It is I who has one last service for you.\"\n\nVariks left before he could change his mind.\n\nA klaxon blared. The voice of the prison's High Servitor echoed over the loudspeakers—in Variks's voice. \"Security systems malfunction. Emergency shutdown and reboot commencing.\"\n\nThe place dropped momentarily into darkness, but emergency lighting quickly illuminated the cellblock. All around him, alarms sounded, warning lights flashed, pneumatics hissed, and cryogenic fluids evaporated to fog as the cryo-cells lining this cellblock began to open.\n\nVariks moved as quickly as he could toward the exit, not bothering to look back, for he knew what he'd see.\n\nThe Scorned Barons and Prince Uldren were free.\n\nAs was every single resident of the Prison of Elders.\n\nVariks slipped out, under cover of prison anarchy, through the same secret passage in which Petra and Cayde had smuggled Prince Uldren. There, a ship waited, loaded with the Prison's Ether stores.\n\nAs he walked, he made two recordings to be sent out by the Prison's relays once he was away. For the first, he disabled his voice synth and began, in the deep resonance of High Speak, to give commands.\n\nHe didn't know how many would answer Judgment's call. But he had to try.\n\nFor the second, he turned his voice synth back on. \"They call me betrayer. I who was most loyal. They do not think I hear the words. Bug. Insect.\" He paused. \"Fallen.\"\n\nUp, long strides, fast now, along the ramp into the ship. Toward the bridge. A vandal in Wolf colors saluted him as he passed.\n\n\"I hear the words. House of Judgement always hears. No choice. To keep the Houses together.\" He paused again, as he reached the bridge of his ship. \"Judgment always hears.\"\n\n\"The Great Machine stood in Judgment. Eliksni fell to fighting. Fell to hate.\" Emotion caught in his voice. \"Cannot stomach this hate.\" As he spoke, the ship's engines rumbled to life. On the screens, Variks could see explosions resonating through the Prison. His former charges running rampant. His ship passed through the bay's barrier and began to move off.\n\n\"Nowhere else to go. No one else to be, here.\" He drew himself up to his full height. \"And so I become Variks, the Kell. House Judgment envoy to the Eliksni people.\"\n\n\"No choice.\" He repeated, chuckling deep in his throat. His voice was calm. \"Eliksni must rise… yes?\""

By random luck, and those steps taken and decisions made. Our individual lives shaped by the person we were, the person we are, the person we claim to be, the person we hope to be—the stages of our singular existence. Or so we tell ourselves, lost as we are in our own stories. In truth, there is no \"I,\" no singular existence. Never has been. Never will be. You. Me. Your fireteam and friends. Your allies and enemies. All lives move with—collide with—other lives, for better or worse, to form the whole of a lifetime (lifetimes?).\n\nIt took me a long time to understand this: None of us are alone. I call it the \"first understanding\"—it's a bit of an inside joke. But I think maybe you get it. In fact, I'm quite certain you do. That's why I'm writing you. That's why now, after a life removed from the bigger picture, I'm risking everything I am on a simple bet—that you are different. That you are better. Than me. Than them—those who would tempt the dark.\n\nThis is what I want—need—you to understand. Your path is not your own. It is shared. It has impact. It carries consequence and creates wake, both obvious and unseen. And the path you're currently walking is… concerning. For yourself, whether you see it or not. More importantly, for others. For those you may—those you will—influence. Collisions yet to come. New paths unimagined. Collateral impacts beyond the narrow view of your own life. Have you considered this? I ask not to sway you; you will find your way, and I will hold off judgment until judgment is necessary. I ask because we are at our best when considering the fallout of our intentions—good or bad, grand or small. That's all I'm after, here and now…\n\nYour consideration. \n\nOf the deeds left behind. And deeds yet to come.\n\nWho do you claim to be? Who do you hope to be? And how do the ripples of those answers expand to touch the lives around you?\n\nThink on your life and your actions. And continue ever forward.\n\nI will help where I can, with knowledge gained from a life hunting the very dangers you tempt. And though we'll never meet—our paths crossing at a distance as we each seek to confront all that drives us—from this moment on, our lives will never be the same.\n\nMy name is Shin Malphur.

Only the broken and the misunderstood. Still terrifying, sure. But knowable. Conquerable. Unworthy of the power they possess. This man, clad in black and misshapen by the weight of his sins, professed to wield hope as a weapon, to offer it as a crutch, a beacon he saw as false promise. \"Nothing dies like hope,\" he'd say. And was right. The loss of hope stings like no other. But he knew something else—a truth he would not share, a truth muddied by his words and deeds and the grim menace of his presence. And that truth?\n\nHope is eternal. \n\nIt may fade. It may get lost in the pain and suffering of existence. But it's always there. Somewhere.

Do you revel in the thrill of facing your equal in combat—in testing the limits of your might? Or do you take pleasure in the breaking of their spirit?  \n\nReflect on the answers you find.

Or pure, anger—vengeance driven by a lust for \"justice\"?\n\nI know the feeling. I know the sensation—loss, followed by a hole so big you can't fill it with anything but retribution. I've felt that hole twice. First when everything I'd known was turned to ash. I was just a child then. No way of knowing when, or if, the pain would end. A man—Jaren, my third father—helped redirect that pain. Give me purpose. Taught me to hunt. Taught me to survive. Taught me about vengeance. \n\nIt felt good—like a fire inside. Or so I thought. In truth, the \"good\" was just a dulling of the pain—a covering up of the burden of my loss through the redirection of my focus. Why be sad? Why be broken? When you can be angry. And so I was. For a long time.\n\nAfter Jaren died—killed by the would-be monster and his Weapon of Sorrow—I hated him for a good while. I was alone again. Lost. I had no direction.

Vengeance—the fire inside me—was a weight, not a comfort, because I lacked the confidence needed to see it through. \n\nI spent a long time mad—at the murderer who played in shadows, at Jaren for leaving me, at the world, at myself for being lost, at Jaren's Ghost for not believing in me. My anger defined me. As did yours. For a short while. What I wonder is, have you ever considered…\n\nCayde's death was not the origin of your recent aggression, but simply a catalyst for its release. That it's possible this whole second life of yours has been driven by vengeance: for the life you lost before your return as a Guardian, for the world—worlds—lost to the Great Collapse.

No—\n\nIt will be your first loud words, and your enemies' last. \n\nDon't question the moment. This is my only, best advice. Take hold. Speak clearly.

Tess sighed. \"He can make the Hive quake in fear, but that man shouldn't be let within 10 meters of a designer's table.\"\n\nThe two women were still laughing when a shudder rocked the Tower. They turned as one in the direction of the far-off sound that followed—a roaring noise neither of them had heard before.\n\nThe PA blared in the small utility room they'd claimed as a lounge. \"Evacuation order 77 is in effect. This is not a drill. All civilians report to designated evacuation areas immediately.\"\n\nTess was at the door, palming it open when another explosion—much closer—shook them where they stood. Smoke and screams floated down the hallway.\n\nEva's memories of what followed were disjointed. She was running with Tess, gasping for breath. She remembered murmuring the names of her cousins, worrying about them down in the City. She was in a large crowd now, Tess was falling behind as Eva was crushed forward.\n\nAnother explosion, and a fire door slammed shut. Tess was gone, and Eva found herself with about 30 people in a small cargo bay between Tower North and the Hall of Guardians. A man was trying the far door, shouting that it was sealed.\n\nThen the roof came down as a large sphere crashed to the decks. Cabal clambered from the pod, struggling against their bulky armor as they began to fire at the civilians.\n\nThat's when a dazzling blast of energy took them from behind. The shouting was enough for ten men, but when Eva could see again, only one massive Guardian was there, ending a Cabal soldier with a blade as long as she was tall.\n\nThe helmeted face of Lord Shaxx turned this way and that, taking in the room. Two quick strides brought him to her side, and with a surprising gentleness, he helped Eva to her feet.\n\n\"Madam.\" He intoned, and she could feel the bass of his voice in her chest. \"I need your help.\"\n\nAt his insistence, she took charge of the civilians as he took point for their little group. With the confidence and looming presence of the Crucible master at her back, it was effortless to keep the others quiet and focused. When they reached an evac site, a trio of anxious-looking Hawk pilots waited with their craft.\n\nAs the last of the group climbed aboard, Shaxx laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. He towered over her as he said, simply, \"Comrade.\" And then he was gone, back toward the fighting, his massive sword slung over his shoulder.

I have a large number of civilians here, and our position is being overwhelmed!\" They punctuated their transmission by leaning out and firing off another half dozen shots. The Cabal roared back in animal fury.\n\nIt wasn't more than two minutes before Eva heard it: the distinctive sound of a Sparrow, running full-out. She dared to gather herself into a half crouch and peer out of the building. She was watching just in time to see a pair of them, a Hunter and a Warlock, descend on the invaders like vengeful angels. These two were professionals, she could tell—no swagger to them. They were efficient and deadly, and the soldiers began to fall back.\n\nSomething happened. Eva couldn't see what it was, but both of the Guardians reeled. The Warlock dropped to one knee, like his strings had been cut. The Hunter shook her head and raised a hand in the air, a distinctive signal, calling for the Light… but nothing happened.\n\nThe Cabal, like they'd been waiting for this moment, struck hard. The Hunter was bowled over by a charging Centurion and crushed underfoot. The Warlock didn't seem to ever really recover, and he fell to the ground, riddled by the weapon fire of a dozen soldiers.\n\nThe Exo was standing fully upright now, shocked, and even as Eva opened her mouth to tell them to get down, they fell—a sniper's target.\n\nOne of the men retched in the corner, horrified. Eva gave herself no time to think. She snatched the comm unit from the ground and pushed past the civilians to a far window. She used the reinforced case to smash out the glass and began hoisting children through once the largest shards were cleared of the frame. She was the last out of the building, and a few stray bullets plucked at the wall near her as she made her escape.\n\nThey didn't stop running until they were sure no one was following. She had no idea which district they were in, no clue even what the building used to be. Much of the orderly streets and well-tended boulevards she knew had become a maze of debris—the last safe City, a maze of collapsed and ruined structures.\n\nThe children were huddled up in a great pile as the older folk talked quietly among themselves. Everyone was crying, on and off, but they tried desperately to keep it quiet. \n\nA high-pitched chirp across the comm unit startled Eva, and she slammed her head back against the wall behind her. She hadn't even realized she still had it. She reached down and keyed the pad.\n\nA hushed voice said \"Ma'am?\"\n\nHer own voice low and shockingly gruff, she answered, \"This is Eva Levante. Is this Tozzi?\"\n\nA pause. \"Tozzi's dead. She wanted me to make sure someone got back to you, though.\" Another long pause. Eva fought the urge to scream. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Levante. Block 10 is just gone. I think some of the automated defenses managed to come online early in the fighting and one of their command ships must have crashed…\"\n\nEva didn't hear the rest of the words."

        "text": "Eva checked the time on the small comms unit she clutched to her chest. It seemed impossible, but it had been under two hours since she'd been sitting and laughing with Tess. Time had stretched for her, like the taffy candies some of the vendors sold during the Dawning festival. She would have sworn it was days ago. Longer than that, when she'd been sitting in her cousin's flat, hugging Valentina. Saying goodbye to Luis…\n\n\"Eva, we don't owe them anything.\" A gruff cough, one of the other civilians. Everyone's voice was a grinding imitation of itself; ash filled the air, and no one could clear their throat.\n\nEva clasped a rag to her mouth as she answered, croaking. \"How dare you?\" Her voice rose with her anger. \"Your whole life they've kept you safe, and now you want to just abandon them?\"\n\nThe subject of their dispute lay collapsed on the floor of the warehouse. A quartet of Guardians, all of them wounded and bleeding from within their flamboyant armor. Even as she weighed the future of their little band, she couldn't help but appreciate their fashion sense. The Hunter, of course, had put in the most effort.\n\nThe man arguing with her was paunchy and fashion-illiterate, wearing a bland functionary uniform: part of the Consensus staff. He scowled at her and grated out, \"We can barely move the lot of us around, let alone all of us and a bunch of wounded, powerless Guardians. Why should we risk our—\"\n\n\"You don't think they've risked their lives a hundred times over for you?\" She pulled the rag away from her face and coughed a mass of phlegm and ash to the side. Her mother would have died all over again of shock. \"We have to keep moving, we have to keep them with us, and we have to hold out. Whatever this is, it's temporary.\"\n\nHe grimaced, but she pressed on. \"When they regain the Light they'll…\"\n\nHer diatribe was cut short by a blast of static on the comm unit, so loud she dropped it on the floor. The reinforced case took the blow, and so everyone around clearly heard the deep voice of Commander Zavala when he began to speak. \"Citizens of the Last City. Hear my words.\"\n\nLike a people dying of thirst, the civilians moved in to circle the comm unit. Zavala had been a pillar, a beacon of hope all their lives. Surely he would…\n\n\"We are abandoning the City. We have evacuated everyone we could, but the Cabal now hunt Guardians in the streets. If you are able, you should make for the wilds.\" Eva felt as if she'd been physically struck.\n\n\"The Cabal have affixed a device to the Traveler and severed our connection to the Light. We cannot hold the City, and we cannot protect you.\" There was a long pause, as if he was weighing his words carefully. When he spoke again, Zavala sounded very, very tired.\n\n\"We are setting a rally point elsewhere in the system—watch for a broadcast. We will return to the City someday, but… I do not know when.\" Another pause. \"Be safe. Be brave.\" And he was gone.\n\nTo their credit, the group did not yell or shout. Even though it had only been a matter of hours, they were all alive because they'd learned not to give away their position. They did cry, though. Tears streaked trails down faces covered in ash; those faces looked from one to another as they sought to understand, to comprehend.\n\nEva did not cry. As she stared at the comms unit, all she could think about were Zavala's shoulders. She'd often joked with him about the size of the pauldrons on his armor, that massive protective plate on his left shoulder. And now… for some reason, she thought she understood. The weight on his shoulders…\n\nEva stood, and all eyes turned to her. She flinched a little. Then, choosing her words carefully: \"Most of them are leaving. So we have to help them.\" She gestured at the Guardians. \"If we can keep them alive, they can protect us, keep us safe.\" She looked around the group, found people nodding.\n\n\"Where do we go?\" one woman asked.\n\nEva looked back down at the comms unit. \"The Cabal will have heard that. They'll be watching the walls, expecting us to try to leave.\" She looked up, out at the room. \"So we stay here. We make for the edge of the City and try to find somewhere the Cabal won't expect us to be.\"\n\nThe seamstress reached down and pulled up the comms unit, slinging it over her shoulder. \"Everybody up. It's a long way to Twilight Gap.\""

        "text": "Just getting to the outskirts of the City was an ordeal. Every day, they saw the Cabal's control tightening. Civilian groups or the odd Guardian tried make a break for it only to be brought down by a swarm of ships hungry for a kill. The streets were no safer, with patrols moving in tandem and tanks rumbling through district centers.\n\nYears of supporting the Guardians, of listening to their idle chatter, had filled Eva's head with details about these horrific invaders. She realized they were doing rigid block-by-block sweeps, unimaginative and plodding. Just as described at the Tower.\n\nTheir group hid and observed and moved only when the Cabal did. In that careful manner, they arrived at the far reaches of the City—parts long abandoned, where Humanity was just a shadow cast upon the walls.\n\nEva found herself in consultation every day, organizing foraging patrols back toward the center. Evenings were spent suggesting strategies for the upcoming days.\n\nAnd to her great satisfaction, she spent nights sitting with a needle and thread, trying to make sure the survivors would stay warm on the move.\n\nAs the three Guardians recovered (they lost the Titan on the way to the Gap), they started offering more guidance. At their suggestion, the survivors never stayed in the same place more than a day or two. They posted lookouts every night and turned on the comms unit only every other day to listen for broadcasts. For chance transmissions. For hope.\n\nEva was there in the room when the Guardians heard Zavala's voice—his short, terse statement played over and over. \"If there is any Light left in the system… we rally on Titan.\"\n\nShe shut the door so the other civilians wouldn't hear and listened as they had it out. The other Warlock, Tam, identified herself as Trinh's sister. They were adamant that they try—somehow—to get offworld and head for Titan. The Hunter, Ramos, was just as adamant they stay.\n\nTheir discussion wound down and came to a slow stop with all three Guardians looking at her. She held up her hands and said, \"I trust you all to do the right thing.\" They stayed. And quickly became integral to the success of their… operation.\n\nWhat had begun as simple survival became an organized effort to evacuate civilians from the Last City. Foraging parties inevitably came back with more people than they left. Scouting parties probed the edges of the City and found avenues of escape, places where the Cabal were lax in their patrols.\n\nEva found that the same skills she'd used to plan holidays at the Tower were invaluable in organizing this underground movement. She cobbled together boards from old classrooms to create a schedule and wrote on the backs of old forms and newsletters to make \"delivery packages\" of civilians and the occasional Lightless Guardian.\n\nDay in, day out, this became her quiet routine. She faded into the background of the Underground: plan, move, sew, repeat. Even when contact was finally made with the Farm and getting survivors to the EDZ became the goal, Eva was always there making sure the trains ran on time.\n\nAfter some thought, she asked that her role not be spread around. She got word to people like Tess that she was alive, and that was enough for her. She had the chance to get out of the City dozens of times.\n\nBut every time she thought she'd take that exit, go with that convoy, she stopped herself. Settled back. Did the work.\n\nThat was how the months of the Red War passed for Eva Levante."

        "text": "\"Abuela? Ma'am?\"\n\nIt was quiet, almost a whisper, but enough to wake Eva. For a spinning, disorienting moment, she thought she was sitting in her living room back in Peregrine district. Her favorite afghan over the end of the couch and Carlos standing over her… but that wasn't Carlos.\n\nThe concerned face of the Hunter, Ramos, looked down at her. More than a few of the Guardians that went through the Underground had taken to calling her grandmother, but Ramos had stuck with the group through all the long months of the war.\n\nHe was very protective, sometimes smothering, and she sighed as she rubbed at her eyes. \"I'm up. I'm up. What time is it?\" She sat up on the old couch she'd been sleeping on, wincing as she tried to sort the knots she'd developed sleeping on her side.\n\n\"Almost 0700?\" His voice was low and a little sheepish.\n\nShe glared at him. \"You were supposed to wake me an hour ago.\"\n\nHis grin was lopsided. \"You needed the sleep.\"\n\nShe stood carefully and tottered on unsteady legs, turning her face away so he couldn't see her annoyance. \"Are they waiting?\"\n\n\"They've only just arrived. One of the reasons I waited. They're not expecting you for another 10 minutes.\" Trying to justify himself.\n\nEva sighed again. \"Thank you, Ramos. You're right; I did need the sleep. I was up again too late last night. Go tell them I'll be right down.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" He sounded happier, and his footfalls as he left the room were light, confident.\n\nEva stepped into the bathroom off the main living quarters of this second-floor flat. Her morning routine sorted, she poured some water out of one of the ration canisters into the stoppered-up sink so she could wash, try to feel a little less like she'd slept on a half-rotten couch in an abandoned building.\n\nWater dripping down her nose, she reached blindly for one of the pieces of scrap cloth they used for towels and dried her face. When her eyes cleared, she found herself looking at a stranger.\n\nEva had always been on the thin side. She could still remember her mother chiding her, telling her to eat and clean her plate. Now the woman staring back at her was positively gaunt. Bags under her eyes, hair chopped brutally short, and her clothes! The clothes she'd been wearing the day of the attack hadn't lasted two weeks, never intended for living rough. The homespun outfit she'd stitched for herself would never have passed muster back at the Tower, but… out here they had to do. At least she'd been able to salvage her trademark shawl. Something to remind her of better days…\n\nAs she drifted into the living room, Eva reflected that better days, of course, were why the group was gathered downstairs. All of the Underground cell leaders gathered in one place for an important—perhaps final—conversation.\n\nFor the Underground, the Red War was a stunning victory. They'd won. The only civilians and Guardians left in the City were those unwilling or unable to go. Eva frowned, saddened.\n\nEvery few weeks they heard stories of a group of Guardians overrun from a supposedly secure bunker by a Legion assault. The loss of civilian life had been staggering, both in the initial assault and the intervening months.\n\nAs she looked down into the street through a slit around the boarded-up window, she had to admit to a feeling of… satisfaction. Now all that was left was for the Underground itself to pull out, make for the Farm and the safety-in-numbers of Hawthorne's group. Eva raised her eyes from the empty streets to the distant sight of the Tower, twisted and ruined.\n\nShe would stay, she had decided. Guardians like Ramos could check on her from time to time, but someone needed to stay behind and keep the lights on. There could be refugees still alive out there. Still hoping for a way… out.\n\nShe turned away from the window to head downstairs when the explosion ripped through the street in front of the apartment, and Eva's world turned white."

        "text": "Eva, for the second time in as many minutes, shook her head and tried to understand where she was. There had been no warning. She'd heard a few seconds of a whining engine overhead, and then a massive explosion ripped through the street in front of the Underground apartment.\n\nThe blast had thrown her to the ground like a doll. Everything hurt, and from somewhere close by she could hear the guttural shouting of Cabal soldiers. The distinctive sound of Guardian weapon fire was answering. Someone was screaming.\n\nWithout thinking, she was on her feet, lurching toward the far corner where her shotgun lay on a side table. Three steps, four, weapon in hand and checked. Just in time as the apartment door flew open and a pair of Psions stepped through, weapons ready.\n\nEva Levante, seamstress of the Tower, would have been taken aback. The gaunt woman she'd just seen in the mirror had spent months dry firing the weapon. Endless drills had trained her for action and her first shot took the one on the right in the chest and blew him out of the room. It had not prepared her for the kickback, however, and she felt something crack in her arm as the weapon bucked against her.\n\nThat flinch saved her life as she unwittingly pivoted to the side, narrowly avoiding shots from the other Cabal creature. Roaring, she raised the weapon against and her answering blast threw him against the far wall.\n\nBreathing heavily, she reloaded the weapon with one hand and waited, listening. No more outside that she could hear. Fighting was fierce downstairs. They needed her. She stepped to the door, weapon outstretched…\n\nThe sound of the wardog bursting through the apartment window was like another explosion. Eva whirled around as the scaly beast scuttled to the side, and another pair threw themselves from the hovering troop transport into the small living space. They landed with surprising grace, and three sets of hungry eyes stared at the seamstress. Drool smeared the floor as three sets of fanged mouths worked, eagerly.\n\nEva fired.\n\nThe beasts charged."

        "text": "Eva Levante stood leaning against the ivy-covered outer wall of the barn, gazing down into the football field at the Farm. The old nets were slack, now. Needed to be rehung. No one came by who cared enough to restring them, and the Farm's current inhabitants were not the sporty type.\n\nBeyond the field were the rolling hills of the European Dead Zone, and on the horizon the twisted, ruined spur that was the Shard of the Traveler. Her first days back on her feet, recovering from the attack at the apartment, she'd stared in wonder at that view. \n\nNow she watched the clouds idly roil and collect around the Shard, bored. Eva smiled, and shifted her weight off the wall and onto the carved cane that kept her upright. To think after everything that had happened, she could be bored.\n\nHer first days at the Farm had been a whirlwind of medical treatments, rushed through by attendants already on their way out as she was coming in. It had been the final days of the Red War, a major operation planned to retake the City.\n\nOne old woman coming in from the Underground was a low priority, and in the commotion even the old friends she'd hoped to see had missed her.\n\nNow, she was alone. Or, mostly alone. She turned her head to see the Cryptarch, Tyra Karn, chattering away with Farm's postal frame. With primary operations returned to the City, Darbi had become Tyra's unofficial research assistant. Together they continued to study and examine Humanity's history through the lens of the Dead Zone, a sideline from the turmoil at the Tower Tyra was apparently only too happy to claim.\n\nThe scout, Devrim, came by every once in a while for a chat as well. When he was feeling cheeky, he referring to their little group as the \"old hands club,\" usually smirking over the top of a cup of tea.\n\nBoth still had official jobs to do, of course, and they took their roles very seriously. \n\nEva was at the Farm very unofficially. Her role at the Tower had never been one vital to operations, of course… but no one had rushed to ask her back to the market, either. Tess and Banshee had reached out once in a while, and she'd given advice on how to set up their new space.\n\nBut Eva was here at the Farm for the lost. \n\nThey trailed into the place in ones and twos. They all shared something in common: the Shard hadn't connected with them. They came to sit and stare at it, off in the distance. To talk about how hard the Red War had been, as unpowered Guardians—some forced by circumstance to literally sit on the sidelines.\n\nWhen the Light had returned, some of them reported that it felt different. It sat under the skin like a suit that didn't quite fit anymore.\n\nA diminutive Exo woman was one of the pilgrims Eva remembered most clearly. She hadn't even known they made Exos that short. The woman shifted and twitched as she talked, unable to calm herself. \n\nAt the mention of the Light fitting differently, a statement she'd heard a lot of Guardians make, Eva asked the same question she always did. \"So does that mean the Light is different now? Or are you?\"\n\nThe Exo stopped and narrowed her eyes, thinking. She was stock still for the first time since arriving at the Farm. \n\nThat was usually how it went. Sometimes asking the question was all it took to get them sorted out. Others took a lot longer, sometimes spending weeks at a time at the Farm just doing as Eva was: staring up at the Shard.\n\nSome… some came to the Farm, found no answers, and left on foot walking toward that great landmark on the horizon. So far as Eva knew, none of them had ever come back through the Farm.\n\nIt was a strange life. Another strange time, another role she'd never asked for. But she found she was good at it.\n\nAnd Eva Levante had no interest in returning to the City."

        "text": "The comms unit in her little room chirped loudly enough to wake Eva from a sound sleep. Eva had turned the little outbuilding into something of a homey space with use of fabrics and art scavenged from the Dead Zone, but as it often did when she woke suddenly these days, it took her a moment to remember where she was.\n\nShe groaned as she slid out of bed, using nearby furniture to steady herself. The damage the War Beasts had done had been extensive, and even now she could feel the tightness in her legs where the Bray tech had knit bone and sinew back together.\n\nShe slumped into the little chair in front of the comms unit. The light from the screen lit the room, which was otherwise almost completely dark. She blearily peered into the unit, as the image of Tess Everis resolved itself. It was daylight in the City, and Tess was impeccably dressed for work.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what time it is here?\" Eva asked, allowing the annoyance to seep into her words.\n\n\"Yes. I do.\" Something in Tess's voice made Eva sit up and look closer. There was a tightness to Tess's face. She looked… frightened.\n\n\"Tess, what's going on? Are you all right?\" Eva was wide awake now, and plucked at the edge of her teal robe to draw it around her. She was suddenly cold.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Just… wanted you to know right away. I bet Tyra's getting a call from Rahool right now.\" Tess looked down and away before looking up into the camera again. \"Sweetie, Cayde's dead. Something happened out at the Reef yesterday. I don't know all the details, but everyone's talking about it.\"\n\nEva's mouth formed a thin, worried line. She'd never been overly fond of the Hunter Vanguard, but so many people looked up to him. Relied on him. And if something was powerful enough to kill Cayde-6… \"The Legion?\"\n\nTess shook her head. \"Still quiet, as far as word around here goes.\" She gave a dim smile for the first time since Eva had picked up. \"You know how reliable the rumor mill is, though. It could be anything.\"\n\nEva sat back in her chair, frowning. \"I'm sorry, dear. I know you liked him.\" Tess shrugged, trying to play it off. \"Don't give me that, we weren't swapping stories in the Market that long ago.\"\n\nTess stopped, and nodded sadly. \"There's going to be a memorial service, I think. Will you come back for it?\"\n\nIt was Eva's turn to look away from the screen. It was the first time someone had asked her to go back. And for a funeral, of all things. Eva was about to make an excuse when Tess continued, her smoky voice taking on a light tinge of humor.\n\n\"While you're here you can sort out the holiday programming for the frames.\"\n\nEva's eyes widened. \"The frames are doing holidays without me?\"\n\nTess's smile broke into a full grin. \"We were just as surprised! Somehow all of the holiday gear got packed along with critical supplies in the transfer to the new Tower. And when your programs kicked in, they were able to find the tagged crates.\" Tess picked up her comms unit and angled the lens so that it would show the Dawning hat sitting on top of a mannequin in the corner of the room.\n\nEva shook her head, disbelieving. \"They did the Dawning without me.\"\n\nTess's face came back into frame. \"Over the summer, Ikora got someone to help her set up an event to commemorate the end of the War, too.\" \n\nEva tried not to let her annoyance show on her face. \"How was it?\"\n\nTess shook her head from side to side, evaluating. \"Oh… you know. OK.\" When she saw Eva's mouth tighten, Tess laughed. \"It didn't have your touch, sweetie.\" She sighed. \"Oh, it feels good to laugh. Come back to the Tower! Even if it's just to pay your respects. I haven't given you a hug in what feels like years.\"\n\nIn the darkness of her room, Eva turned to look out her window. On the horizon, the dim glow of the Shard was like an anchor, a symbol of the past.\n\nEva looked back toward her friend and smiled."

She turned to the two frames who were accompanying her and pointed inside.\n\n\"Start by sanitizing the whole space. When it's clean, we'll start moving in the crates.\" The frames both nodded to her and beeped affirmation. They were already sweeping with abandon as they crossed the threshold. Eva stumped back several paces, supported by her cane, to avoid getting any dirt on her outfit.\n\nAround her, the marketplace swirled with activity. Civilians on break ate at the lunch counter, shoppers browsed the stalls, frames cleaned and patrolled and delivered goods, and Guardians were everywhere—a riot of color and style as they flipped and floated and leapt around the space.\n\nEva scowled, frustrated with herself again for letting Tess and (to an extent) Amanda talk her into returning. None of this felt right, none of it felt… comfortable. And now this space they'd given her to store her wares had apparently last been opened and cleaned sometime before the Faction Wars.\n\nShe found a bench along one of the market's walkways and sank gratefully down, watching the crowd pass by. Fashion, as it always did in the City, had moved quickly since the day the Legion attacked. She was still catching up, still finding her footing. Rebreather masks in particular dotted the faces in the crowd, more stylish and ornamental than practical—a holdover from a necessity in the days rebuilding and restoring the City.\n\nAnd the Guardians! Tess had spent much of their time together since her return filling her in on fashion trends among the Lightbearer set, and Eva was incredibly impressed. Tess, the foundries, even the Vanguard had outdone themselves. Armor designs and shader schemas had improved dramatically since her days at the old Tower.\n\n\"What am I even going to do here?\" she muttered to herself. \"What can I do that…\" she trailed off, watching a Guardian walk by with what appeared to be a full crest rising above his helmet and a Warlock robe that flowed and rippled behind him in the breeze.\n\n\"That's it.\" Eva stood, heading for the door to tell the frames to stop cleaning, when someone stepped into her path. A Guardian in a leather trench coat, with a shiny black helm.\n\n\"Eva?\" The voice was distorted. She could see her own face reflected in the helmet, confused.\n\nThe gloved hands came up and the headpiece came off to reveal the smiling face of Ramos. \"Abuela! It's me!\" He pulled her into an enormous hug as she smiled.\n\n\"You rascal. You never gave me the chance to thank you.\" She swatted him kindly on the shoulder as she pulled away. \"Just save a woman's life and then ride off to retake the City, why don't you?\"\n\nRamos laughed, happier than she'd ever seen him. The Light hung around him easily, and he turned to a pair of Guardians who were standing nearby, watching tentatively. \"Team, this is Eva Levante! You remember my stories? This woman is a legend!\"\n\nHe gestured at the two. \"Eva, these two are shiny as Glimmer. Just became Guardians before the Legion attacked.\"\n\nEva nodded her head deeply to them. \"Good to meet you both.\"\n\nOne raised a hand in an awkward greeting, while the other cocked their head. \"What… do you do here?\"\n\nEva sighed. \"Oh, I'm not… I'm not actually.\"\n\nRamos laughed and said, \"She's a phenomenal seamstress! A hero of the war! And before that, she was one of the pillars of life in the Tower. Remember the Dawning holiday you liked so much? She brought that to the Tower!\"\n\nThe two turned back to her, impressed. \"How did you get Zavala to agree to… to…\"\n\nEva smiled. \"To have fun?\" She laughed at the responses she got from all three Guardians, and tapped her cane twice on the ground. \"That's a very good story. If you have some time?\"\n\nRamos laughed. \"Absolutely! Come, let's get some food. And we can help these Kinderguardians learn a thing about what it means to be part of the Tower.\"\n\nWith help from her friend, Eva Levante walked easily across the market square of the Tower, bastion of the Last Safe City. Home."

        "text": "I've known Zavala a long time, you know. He was one of the first people to greet me when I arrived at the Tower all those years ago—though I suppose \"greet\" may be too soft a word. It implies a sort of friendliness, a warmth. And Zavala… if you've never met him? He can be a bit stern. He's hardened further since the Red War, I'm sorry to see—though I suppose we all have, to some degree. In any case, that very first meeting left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to admit that I avoided Zavala when I could after that—though sometimes he makes himself unavoidable.\n\nIt wasn't long after this meeting that I celebrated my first Dawning at the Tower. Everyone's spirits were high, and it was so nice to see the people I had come to care about smiling and toasting each other. I remember Tess and I had just finished with a bit of decorating, and she had left to get something when Zavala began heading my way. \"Oh no,\" I thought. \"Oh no, not this man.\" Ah, but he came over anyway, so I smiled and wished him a Happy Dawning—because I DID wish good things for him. It is often the sternest among us who hold the saddest hearts.\n\nHe wished me the same, and then—I almost couldn't believe it—he smiled! We exchanged some brief pleasantries, and… I don't remember what I said that brought this on, but suddenly he said, \"Oh, that reminds me of a joke!\"\n\nA joke! At first I thought I must have heard him wrong, because the Titan Vanguard had always struck me as the \"no time for joking\" sort. But he had barely begun telling this story before I noticed how much more relaxed his posture was. It seemed the spirit of the Dawning had reached even this stone man.\n\nI remember only pieces of the joke these days—I believe it had to do with a Guardian and a Fallen Captain?—but I clearly remember that he stumbled over the first few words and had to start again. I gave the warmest smile I could to encourage him, and he went on to tell one of the longest, most awkward jokes I have ever heard. And listen, I loved every minute of it. Truly, I couldn't have been happier. Oh, I clapped and laughed along with what I swear was real, true joy from Zavala. To have such a guarded soul open like that—few things are more beautiful. I admired him so in that moment, that he could push himself beyond the boundaries he'd held himself to. I remember hoping that I could someday be so brave in my own way. For the first time, I didn't just respect him as one of the City leaders. For the first time, I felt real, genuine affection for Zavala, the person. Zavala, my friend.\n\nHe has been dear to my heart ever since.\n\n---\n\nGjallardoodles:\nMix Ether Cane and Delicious Explosion, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "When Tess told me that the frames had organized the Dawning in the new Tower while I was all the way out at the Farm, I thought, how could they do it without me? Then I said, Eva, these traditions are bigger than you. They live in the hearts and minds of the people who have passed them on, generation after generation!\n\nNow I am back in the Tower, helping to create the loveliest Dawning celebration yet. And I carry on a tradition I am sure to repeat every year: I ask Ikora to make the Dawning Crystal, and I ask until she does it.\n\nI make an appointment to discuss the decorations, but I know she's always very busy with urgent Vanguard business. That is why, when I approach her alcove and hear low voices, I don't barge right in; I just peek a little bit.\n\nIkora is muttering—she sounds almost angry. \"Dawning decorations! I've got no time for frivolous…\"\n\nA male voice says, \"It is not 'frivolous.' People need this. I understand that it's hard for you because it's the first Dawning without Cay—\"\n\n\"Stop talking, Ophiuchus. Right now.\" I do not see who Ikora is talking to or recognize this name, but Ikora's voice is sharp. \"I have other concerns. What about the latest reports out of the Tangled Shore? I don't know what to make of them. And my Hidden have reported trouble brewing closer to home…\" I notice her eyes drift across the main passageway, to a secluded nook with a partially closed gate.\n\n\"Yes, Ikora. But—\"\n\n\"And there's never any word from Osiris. Not that I expect it, but…\" She shakes her head.\n\n\"With respect, why not just message him?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I just don't have the time to…\" She pauses. \"Eva Levante!\"\n\nI make sure to tread loudly and rustle my sheaf of Dawning Crystal designs as I enter (why have her think I was eavesdropping?). Ikora watches me, her arms crossed. Her Ghost hovers by her ear, whirring with alertness.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Ikora Rey!\" I begin. She can tell by my big bright smile and the firm way I spread out the designs for her to pick from that it will go faster if she says yes. She respects our tradition, though; she says no twice, then she says fine, Eva, fine. She does not believe the crystal matters, though; she avoids my gaze, but her Ghost—I see his eye blink at me.\n\nThe design she promises to make is exquisite.\n\nWe agree to meet again when she finishes it. I join her in the Bazaar while running errands with my assistant Malia—so many last-minute tasks! When we march up, Ikora and her Ophiuchus are huddled together. She keeps shaking her head. But still she lifts her arms, and suddenly an enormous Dawning Crystal winks into being in the skies above the Tower, like a million diamonds suspended in air.\n\nMalia gasps. She has never been so high in the Tower, nor seen the Dawning Crystal up close; only from the City far below. She drops all the packages she was carrying.\n\nThe Warlock Vanguard helps Malia pick them up, piling one parcel on top of another until she realizes Malia is still as stone, kneeling, watching her, watching her hands that had kindled light from air. The poor girl's scarred face is slick with tears, and she wipes them with her sleeve, but the tears will not stop. Malia's family escaped the City during the Red War, you see; though they survived and have a home again, there have never been many beautiful things in their lives.\n\nMalia touches Ikora's arm and mouths a thank-you. Her cheeks flush red as a pincushion.\n\nThen I kneel too (a bit slowly nowadays) to take the packages from Ikora—all but one, bound in golden ribbon and embossed with an open eye encircled by a sun. I nod and press it into her hands. Then I hear that Ghost of Ikora's whisper, \"I told you so,\" and Ikora reply, \"So you did.\"\n\n---\n\nTraveler Donut Holes:\nMix Cabal Oil and Flash of Inspiration, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "Amanda once told me that her mother, Nora, came from desert people, in a place far, far from here. Nora had been on the road since she was a girl, sometimes with nothing more than an old scribbled map and that shotgun of hers. She didn't need much, but she did need people. Nora met Amanda's father in some half-abandoned village, and when she told him about the Last Safe City, well, he followed her. They had no family but themselves. They picked up fellow refugees on the way. Lost others.\n\nThen they had their precious little girl. It must have been a slow, slow road—first with a little baby, then with a young child. But they believed. They had hope. They pushed on.\n\nAmanda told me about one particular Dawning they had shared out in the wilds. They had fallen in with another family that had a child, Lucia, a bit older than little Amanda. They were agreeable travel companions. They found themselves in the thick of the forest, with the wind wailing, a storm coming down, branches flying… and realized they had to stay put.\n\nSo, they find the wreckage of a dropship, lean up a wing and crumpled siding, and squeeze all the grown-ups and the two little ones into the dry space under the rusted hull.\n\nThen Amanda's mother says, \"We'll be here a while. Might as well do something to keep our spirits up.\"\n\nShe sends the adults out foraging for something to eat, something to drink, and something to keep dry. Amanda's father comes back with long-leaved plants to weave into mats. Their companions return with full water flasks, some prickly fruit, and a dozen or so wild vegetables like cucumbers. With dried fish from their packs, it is quite the feast.\n\nAs the adults are working, Lucia is curling the rinds from the fruit into little flowers, but little Amanda is kicking her legs, restless. \"Make yourself useful; make some decorations,\" Amanda's mother urges her. She hands Amanda wires and nuts and bolts and a circuit board full of little lights.\n\nLucia comes jumping, an old battery in her hand. Together the girls make miniature garlands of tiny bulbs. And Lucia shows Amanda how to touch the wires to the battery to make them light up. Bright little lights in the vast dark forest.\n\nAmanda told me about the fruit, with soft white flesh and a sour taste. She told me about how they sang made-up songs together with no words, just humming and tapping out a beat on the metal walls of their shelter.\n\nShe doesn't know what the fruit was. Maybe it does not exist anymore. The other family? They got separated from Amanda's people. Later on, Amanda's parents… gone, like so many others on the road to the Last Safe City.\n\nBut Amanda Holliday still makes the lights, you know. Uses spare odds and ends to decorate her workshop. She does it every Dawning.\n\n---\n\nChocolate Ship Cookies:\nMix Cabal Oil and Null Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "Some residents of the Tower have been around very long indeed. The Guardians, the Exos, the old Iron Lord—they have seen Dawning after Dawning. Even before the Tower began observing the holiday as we now know it, there were those who would always celebrate with similar ceremonies of light and hope. Sometimes these memories blend together. But the feeling… the feeling remains.\n\nThis Dawning season—last week? the week before? I can't even remember, haha!—one of my suppliers tells me they had two of my boxes delivered to the Gunsmith by mistake. So, I go to see Banshee-44 to sort it all out.\n\nThe Exo has no recollection of a delivery. But he recognizes me, and I notice his eyes glow a teensy bit brighter. \"Must be about the Dawning,\" he mumbles, and he turns on his heel and heads straight to some shelves at the back. He returns with two big boxes.\n\n\"These them?\" he asks.\n\nWe open the first one up. Inside, we find a very, very old box of chocolates. Many different portable kits for cleaning weapons. A copy of \"Hunter of the Heart\" (I know this novel, but it is not for everyone). A necklace with a bullet pendant, tucked with care into a little box. Stacks and stacks of Dawning greeting cards.\n\nI shake my head gently. \"Those are presents people have given YOU for the Dawning, Banshee!\"\n\nThe Gunsmith blinks a couple of times. Then, he closes the carton—I worry he should have thrown away the chocolates, but maybe next year—and then turns to the other one on the counter. He lifts the cover.\n\nIt is full of Dawning gifts, wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with glittery ribbon. Some are in tiny boxes, but some are guns, of course. They are all meticulously labeled.\n\n\"I think these are the presents you are giving out to friends this year, no?\" I ask with a wink.\n\nBanshee gives one brisk nod as he turns over the labels, reading them. I observe that some have detailed instructions. The Exo shrugs.\n\n\"Got in the habit of writing everything down. Sometimes I… I don't always remember.\" He waves the thought away. \"Right.\"\n\n\"I still need my supplies? The boxes I came to get?\" I nudge him.\n\nHe tilts his head a moment and finally raises a finger. \"Oh. I know where they are.\"\n\nBut before he takes away his boxes, I tap the covers. \"You should label them. 'Old Dawning Gifts.' 'New Dawning Gifts—To Be Delivered.'\" He nods at me and scribbles on the lids.\n\n\"I never forget my friends for the Dawning,\" he makes sure to tell me as he hands me my packages.\n\n\"I'm very glad. Happy Dawning, Banshee!\" I reply, squeezing his arm.\n\nI do hope he remembers to get rid of those chocolates.\n\n---\n\nTelemetry Tapioca:\nMix Vex Milk and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "Sometimes, when I face something frightening, I think of the strongest people I know and draw strength from them. Suraya Hawthorne is one of those people. I know her brusque attitude can be off-putting, and that's intentional on her part. But once you get past that, there is so much to learn.\n\nShe was orphaned as a young girl, and Devrim and Marc took her in. Honestly, I think having these two as role models is part of why she's as strong as she is. They raised her to be sure of herself and to always do what she thought was right… even though that ultimately led to her having to leave the City.\n\nAs Suraya tells it, she came home one day to find Marc and Devrim sitting at the kitchen table, as though expecting her. They had her sit down, then asked if there was anything she wanted to tell them.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Nope.\"\n\nMarc asked her to try again, but she was silent, so he told her that Executor Hideo had stopped by their home. She asked how he was.\n\n\"You know how he is,\" Devrim said. \"Tell us what happened.\"\n\n\"His face got in the way.\"\n\nMarc took a deep breath and said Hideo claimed to have caught her stealing supplies that morning, and did she have anything to say about that? She did not.\n\nHe reminded her that stealing supplies and breaking a faction leader's nose were both good ways to get kicked out of the City, and Suraya could keep quiet no longer. She almost shouted her explanation: The factions didn't care about the people who needed food and supplies—the people who could not pledge to a faction because they were too busy struggling to survive. She wanted to help them, so she would sometimes steal supplies from New Monarchy.\n\nDevrim asked, \"What about Hideo?\"\n\nSuraya rolled her eyes and groaned, explained that when Hideo had found her, he'd said all manner of nasty, evil things to her: She was worthless, she was nothing, things like that.\n\nDevrim agreed Hideo was… well, I won't repeat it, but suffice to say it means \"an unpleasant person.\" He held a lot of influence, though, and he was insisting Suraya be punished. Harshly. For Suraya's part, this seemed to crystallize something. She tells me that's the first time she knew she wanted to leave the City—that perhaps this had been part of why she'd punched Hideo. She told her guardians and they couldn't believe it.\n\nThey were quiet for a bit. Then Devrim broke the silence. \"Well, let's get packed.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Absolutely not.\" She was not about to let her decisions hurt these men who had taken her in and cared for her. They'd done nothing wrong.\n\nOh, they fought her. As she tells it, they argued a long time, until finally, she shrugged and said, \"If you try to come with me, I'll run away.\"\n\nShe suspected they knew there was no bluff to call, as they spoke now in tired, worried voices, making their case one last time. Suraya was adamant. \"I won't let you suffer for my choices.\" What could they do?\n\nShe asked when she had to leave. Marc said he could hold off Hideo for a day or two so they could all make a plan. His voice became stern again, and he said, \"You're going somewhere close enough that we can come and check on you as often as we like. At least for a while. That is nonnegotiable.\"\n\nHe had no negotiating power, of course. But Suraya had agreed. She stayed very near the City for over a year before saying proper goodbyes and heading out further into the world. \n\nSuraya Hawthorne is, in my mind, the definition of doing what you think is right regardless of the consequences. She knew it was right to help struggling families, she knew it was right to not put Devrim and Marc in harm's way, and she knew it was right to give them some peace of mind by staying close. That is the kind of true courage I have always admired.\n\n---\n\nEliksni Birdseed:\nMix Ether Cane and Personal Touch, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

He'd come by from time to time, to check in on everyone and make sure everything was going all right. We even sat down to tea a few times. Such a kind, sincere soul. We need more of those, you know.\n\nWe talked many times about the war, and he tried so hard to convince me to arm myself. \"You've seen what's out there,\" he would say, as though I might have forgotten.\n\nWe argued about it time and time again. I had jobs that didn't require fighting, I would explain, and that was intentional. My strongest contributions lay elsewhere, and I meant to keep my focus there.\n\nI remember one conversation in particular where Devrim was absolutely adamant. \"Eva!\" he finally said, louder than I think he meant to. His eyes were urgent, almost angry, as they locked on mine. \"This isn't some 'what if' situation. You've already had to defend yourself. It stands to reason you'll have to again. The Cabal aren't backing down, and they're not the only threat. To know all that and still not even try to protect yourself… it's irresponsible.\"\n\nYes, I had defended myself. And I had hated everything about it.\n\n\"Devrim.\" I kept my voice soft, but my words clear. \"The fighting, the shooting, the mayhem—that's not what I want to be part of. I've seen enough. If it comes for me again—and I agree, it could—then so be it. I want to be part of the healing. I want to be part of what builds us back up. Don't we need that?\"\n\nPoor Devrim finally stopped trying to convince me. He never stopped checking in, though. Old habits, as they say.\n\nWhen I finally came back to the Tower, though, what do you think was waiting for me? The Dawning festival was just beginning, and the Postmaster had a package for me. Inside, a beautiful sidearm—ornate design, antique coloring—and a note. From Devrim, of course.\n\nAt first I was indignant—after all our conversations! I had half a mind to simply throw this gun away. Instead, I read the note.\n\n\"Eva, my friend!\n\nI was sorry to hear you'd left the Farm after all, but very glad to know you'll be among dear friends. In that spirit, and in the spirit of the Dawning, I wanted to offer you this gift. This has been passed down through my family for generations. It's a Kay family heirloom—and before you throw it away, you should know that it doesn't fire. I thought this might be a nice compromise, and I hope you'll accept it.\n\nI hope the Tower treats you well, old friend.\n\n—Devrim\"\n\nI read the note a few more times, then folded it and put it in my pocket.\n\nI looked down once more at this beautiful heirloom—a symbol of friendship, of family—and reflected on the fact that somehow, despite everything, I'd managed to rediscover both.\n\n---\n\nGentleman's Shortbread:\nMix Ether Cane and Perfect Taste, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

One of my favorite letters came from someone who was a customer of mine but once: Lady Sloane, Stoneborn out on Titan, one of Saturn's moons.\n\n\"Dear Eva,\n\n\"Happy Dawning.\n\n\"First, thanks for the delivery; all the requisitions arrived in perfect condition, and you did a great job packaging up the chicken (more on that later). We tried decorating the railings outside our Command Center with the garlands, but the Fallen have been using the lights for target practice. I guess we'll be getting some more next year and prettying up the break room instead. A couple of the Dawning lanterns got whipped away in the wind, too—we're not known for our clement weather out here on the methane seas.\n\n\"Some Guardians who've been helping me out on Titan mentioned that you like to hear about Dawning traditions outside the City, so here's how we celebrate on this moon we call home.\n\n\"This year, I let the crew off duty early, 1600 hours, and took a whole hour off myself so we could have ourselves a little Dawning soirée in our Command Center.\n\n\"Siren's Watch has got quite a view of the waves and some floating platforms, so we pushed our break room tables together, end to end, and looked out at the horizon while we shared a communal feast. Seeing as the room is exposed to the elements (the glass view window broke long ago, but repairing it just hasn't been a priority), Del and Ari had to bundle up—and we had to weigh the tablecloth down with chunks of metal. I've had worse setups.\n\n\"Eva, it was the best meal I've had in ages. That chicken? Delicious. Every one of us got to try a piece. We cut our protein rations into fun shapes, and once we got your taffy warmed up enough to chew, it was heaven.\n\n\"We exchanged Dawning gifts as well. Somebody even cross-stitched me an 'inspirational quote' to hang in my quarters ('Where's my beacon?'; it's an in-joke). Decent tools, Heavy ammo, thick socks—those are the kinds of gifts that change hands out here. Maybe that doesn't impress people accustomed to the Dawning in the Tower, but those presents have worth to us.\n\n\"When we joined hands afterward, whether for warmth or just conviviality, we got to talking in a way we never really had before. I don't think I've ever voluntarily shared stories about myself in my life! We talked about who we were before the Red War, where we came from, and even where we might want to go in the future.\n\n\"It's not easy here on this storm-tossed moon—one jolt and you're tumbling off a platform into eternity. Between the Fallen and the Hive and the elements, we're always just struggling to stay alive. But as we sat there chatting, we FELT alive.\n\n\"I guess I wrote all this just to say thank you, Eva, for reminding us to take a moment to appreciate and rejoice, no matter what. I find that inspiring.\n\n\"Sincerely,\n\"Sloane\"\n\nI have never left Earth, and Titan sounds like a… very interesting place. But reading how this holiday has brought people together in such faraway places, I feel all my efforts have been worth it.\n\nI hope to see Sloane again someday.\n\n---\n\nAlkane Dragée Cookies:\nMix Chitin Powder and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

To tell you the truth, I had forgotten about it until more recently, when some Guardians told me they found one of them crashed on Nessus—and explained what had happened to its Failsafes.\n\nI understand they were originally one AI—the ship's navigational intelligence—but with time, they separated. It sounds to me like one of them is always happy, and the other is always sad. That's no way to live for either of them. These things must exist in balance. I know they're computers, but I worry for them.\n\nOne Guardian in particular spoke to me recently of the time he told the Failsafes about the Dawning festival. He had just turned some bounties in to them and mentioned that he was excited to get back to Earth to participate in the festivities. They stopped him and asked him to explain what that meant—they had never heard of the Dawning! He said something to the effect of, \"It's a winter celebration that combines several old Earth traditions.\"\n\nThey responded—I will try to word this exactly as he did, since he prided himself on his imitation of them—they responded by the happy one saying, \"According to my database, Earth's 'winter' occurs when one hemisphere is oriented away from the sun! Why do you celebrate being cold?\" Then the sad one said, \"I mean, I can't feel cold, but it sounds awful.\"\n\nSo this Guardian said something like, \"It's more that we're celebrating each other,\" which I love, because that is how I've always thought of it as well. We're all here together, eating sweets and being with each other.\n\nThe Failsafes asked a few more questions and then the happy one said, \"If we are celebrating each other, how can I participate in the Dawning? I am all alone. It is very depressing!\" The sad one said, \"I'm not gonna celebrate the Fallen.\"\n\nMy Guardian friend thought quickly and said, \"You can wish every Guardian that comes out to Nessus a happy Dawning! Celebrate with us! We would love that.\"\n\nThat seemed to cheer both of them up a bit, so I'm glad he thought to say it. Apparently, they practiced wishing him a happy Dawning for the better part of an hour, so I expect they're quite good at it now. Go visit them if you have a chance.

        "text": "\"Eva Levante!\" Ikora caught my wrist and leaned in to whisper. \"I need to speak with you about Eris Morn.\"\n\nAh, I will never forget that day. Way back then, I was very busy getting the Vanguard and the other Tower vendors excited about the Dawning. In turn, many reached out to me about anything related to the holiday. Still, I was surprised that the Warlock Vanguard would seek me out—and to talk about Eris Morn, of all people!\n\nI might have shuddered in spite of myself.\n\n\"I saw you chatting with her as you were getting the decorations set up…\"\n\nWhat I recalled was Eris talking at me about abysses while I was trying to hang lanterns, but I did not want to say that to Ikora.\n\nShe continued, \"I am worried about her. She seems quite depressed.\"\n\nI flicked my eyes up at Ikora and then looked away. To my credit, I did not snort.\n\n\"She's even more morose than usual, and the technicians in the Hall of Guardians are complaining. Eva, could you talk to her? Perhaps… get her to help you out? Surely you could use an extra set of hands.\"\n\nA terrible idea, but again, I could not say so. Instead I suggested, \"Perhaps she has a friend—well, maybe not a 'friend'—but somebody she likes to talk to, someone who she has something in common with…\" I trailed off, remembering who we were speaking of.\n\nBut Ikora perked up. \"There is someone she addresses voluntarily—a Gensym scribe named Asher Mir. He's also, well… He's an excellent scholar. I'll reach out to him, unless YOU know him, of course…\"\n\n\"I don't!\" I said brightly. \"But I hope it goes well; I want everybody to have a happy Dawning. Now if you'll excuse me, I do have deliveries to make.\"\n\nI wasn't yet familiar enough with Ikora to squeeze her arm in farewell, so I nodded and made my escape.\n\nBut when I crossed paths with her again later that day, what a look she gave me! \"I talked to Asher, as you suggested,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He grumbled at first. He seemed unaware that the Dawning was taking place, in fact. But I explained, and when I told him it would be… very well regarded if he wrote her a Dawning greeting card or went to visit her, he said he could write a card. He also said he had a Dawning gift for her.\"\n\n\"Oh! How kind!\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" she sighed and produced a piece of parchment.\n\nIt was folded in four to form a greeting card. Nothing on the cover, but inside was written, \"Eris, the Warlock Vanguard has approached me about 'cheering you up' for a holiday that is going on. I shall seize this serendipitous opportunity to send you the research notes you demanded of me on heretical practices among the Hive, however spurious the grounds for your request. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! —Asher Mir\"\n\n\"Did you dictate that last part to him, Ikora?\"\n\nShe paused for a moment. \"Yes.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Well, you had better take it to her. I wouldn't call Hive research a traditional Dawning present, but she did request it.\"\n\nIkora shook her head wearily, and we parted ways.\n\nLater that same day, as I was about to head out on my last round of deliveries, Ikora approached me yet again.\n\nShe told me, \"I went to see Eris. I don't know if she's any more cheerful, although she did say, 'Ah yes, I had been expecting these notes for some time now. Good.' She even wrote a Dawning message back to Asher.\"\n\nIkora handed me back the same piece of parchment that her scribe colleague had used, but it had been refolded. I read, \"Asher: Take heed not to succumb to the whispers, as fools do. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! —Eris Morn\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\nThe Warlock cleared her throat. \"Eris also had a Dawning gift for me to pass on to Asher.\"\n\n\"At least she's making an effort.\"\n\n\"Well…\" Ikora hauled me aside and took out a small, lumpy packet wrapped in cloth. She peeled back the layers of tissue with care. And there it was. The Dawning gift glowed with a sickly green luminescence.\n\n\"I can't give this to him!\" Ikora hissed. \"I can just...\" She looked around for eavesdroppers. \"...get rid of it, right?\"\n\n\"This is beyond a question of Dawning etiquette,\" I whispered back.\n\nShe nodded, her face set. \"Let us never speak of this again.\"\n\n---\n\nRadiolarian Pudding:\nMix Vex Milk and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

How I jumped!\n\nIt was… a certain well-known Titan—not Zavala, but I will not tell you who. Eva Levante does not tattle about sensitive matters.\n\nHe was carrying a formidable piece of weaponry, a complicated curve of many metal parts with a thick string connecting the ends. \"It's a compound bow,\" he explained, following my stare. \"For shooting arrows.\" I raised my eyebrows in puzzlement.\n\nOn that weapon, he had placed a large pouf of red velvet ribbon. A bow on a bow.\n\nI could tell from the tilt of his helmet and his taut grip on the weapon that something was amiss.\n\nI sighed. I saw this a few times every Dawning.

I wouldn't know the difference between those weapons, but I understood his problem.\n\n\"But maybe a book would be better?\" he asked.\n\n\"Again, it depends which book you choose.\"\n\n\"I have read Ikora's 'On Circles: Revised Edition,' and it was very good.\"\n\n\"That is a terrible Dawning gift. Might I suggest literature?\"\n\nTorito tapped the horn on his helmet to reflect. \"I did destroy a book of hers once. Should I replace it?\"\n\n\"Maybe you should not remind her of a bad thing happening…\"\n\nHe didn't reply to this, so I went on, \"Perhaps this bow is already the right Dawning gift for your friend. Do you think she would use it?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I smiled, \"you have your answer. Happy Dawning to you and your friend both!\"\n\n\"And to you, Eva. I hope your Dawning is one to remember.\"\n\nThen the Titan thanked me, hefted the bow, and strode off.\n\n---\n\nVanilla Blades:\nMix Cabal Oil and Sharp Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "I always seem to get a customer with many questions right as things get busiest, in the late afternoon. Today it was a woman. A beautiful, sturdy Guardian with dark, cropped hair and a diagonal stripe of white across each eye—very striking! She had a satchel slung over one shoulder and a stack of books and packages cradled in one arm. By this, I guessed she was a paying customer. She also had a cheeky curl to her lip and a hand on her hip, and she tap-tap-tapped her fingers as she waited. By this, I guessed she was a Hunter.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Miss…?\" I greeted her.\n\nShe launched right in. \"Can you help me put together a really small, intimate Dawning celebration? Do you have, like, a kit or something?\" she asked, peering back over her shoulder with impatience. \"It's a surprise for… somebody who's used to the Dawning in the City, only now we're all the way over on Mars, so…\"\n\n\"Ah! Well, the Dawning basics are decorations, shared food, and gifts. First: you have a choice of lanterns\"—I pointed to the colorful spheres lining the shop—\"and candles\"—I produced a box of tea candles from under the counter and thumped it down in front of her—\"and streamers.\"\n\n\"Candles and streamers are a fire hazard. I'll take candles and lanterns.\"\n\n\"Silver and yellow lanterns go well together…\"\n\nShe squinted up at my display. \"Purple.\"\n\n\"I'll give you purple, green, and silver. That's a pretty combination. The Dawning is about wonder and beauty, so you don't buy just one lantern.\" I stacked the accordioned lanterns on top of the candles.\n\nShe opened her mouth and then shut it again. I pulled out my biggest assortment of Dawning treats and placed it on the counter. \"Sharing and generosity are the heart of the Dawning. This collection is the one you want\"—here I paused—\"if you want to impress someone you love.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips and pushed the beribboned package of sweets next to the candles and lanterns.\n\nSmiling, I pulled over a rack of my finer garments. \"Finally, the Dawning gift: the most important—\"\n\n\"Oh, I've already got a good Dawning gift.\" She put her belongings on the counter to point out the necklace box on top. I also happened to scan the spines of the thick books, some with very long titles, all labeled, \"Fu'an Library – REFERENCE – DO NOT REMOVE.\"\n\nThe Hunter noticed my frown and shoved the books into her satchel. \"Here's what I picked. Think she'll like it?\"\n\nI didn't know who 'she' was. But I admired the necklace she was showing off: an elongated pendant with an emblem of a little bird, of exquisite workmanship.\n\nShe grinned, \"That design is Golden Age, but the pendant also holds thirty-five petabytes of data!\"\n\nI returned her smile. I also convinced her to buy a sturdy book bag and purple wrapping paper.\n\n\"There! Your own personal Dawning in a bag!\" I said, tucking away her Glimmer and handing over her purchases. \"I hope your companion enjoys the surprise.\"\n\nThe Hunter bobbed her head in thanks and turned to go.\n\n\"Anastasia!\"\n\nWho did I see then but Commander Zavala, standing arms akimbo in the corridor as the press of the afternoon shopping crowd flowed around him.\n\n\"Zavala,\" muttered the Hunter. She pushed her shoulders back and thrust out her chin; she looked fierce as a falcon.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Ana. I'm surprised to see you in the Tower.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I had errands…\"\n\nBut I missed what else they said, because someone ran up with a package, asking, \"Hey, did I hear that woman was headed back to Mars? This one's going there, too.\"\n\nI ran my eyes down the packing list: candles, lanterns, candy assortment, wrapping paper, cloak… Ordered by a Camrin Dumuzi. I got a funny feeling, it was such a coincidence…\n\n\"I think this is meant to be a surprise. The package can wait for tomorrow's deliveries,\" I replied.\n\nWhen I looked back, Zavala and the Hunter were deep in conversation, the Titan Vanguard wearing a half smile and the woman smirking. By this, I guessed that the Dawning spirit was uniting old friends.\n\nAnd with that, I turned to my next customer.\n\n---\n\nJavelin Mooncake:\nMix Chitin Powder and Sharp Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

The different varieties can be hard to recognize when you're young, but with time, you'll see them all. The rarest form is genuine kindness, though there is also \"fair weather\" friendly, \"I want something\" friendly, and \"look how friendly I am\" friendly. That last one is always hiding something, and they hope their performance covers it up.\n\nThis last group is also where we find that man who calls himself the Drifter. I do not like to speak ill of others, but him? Him I do not trust.\n\nI don't really know what he does out beyond that gate, and I'm not sure I want to know. I've spoken to him only a couple of times. He always seems like he's in a rush.\n\nThe one conversation we've had beyond our introduction was very short, and he slinked away before I could get any answers. It was right before the start of the Dawning festival. I was getting my decorations set up as he walked up to my booth and asked, \"Well, what's all this?\"\n\n\"Surely you know of the Dawning?\" I said—not in a rude way, but in a friendly way. \"I know you're a snake\" friendly.\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" he said. \"I guess I'd forgotten it was gettin' to be that season. Time just goes right on by, don't it, sister? Right on by.\" He looked up at the decorations for a long time, hands on his hips and nodding approvingly.\n\n\"It certainly can,\" I said. \"Actually, I wanted to ask—\"\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I don't know that I've been anywhere that actually celebrated the Dawning. Why don't you tell me a thing or two?\"\n\nI may not be centuries old, my friend, but I am no naïve child either. Old Eva knows a lie when she hears it. I spent a bit of time telling him about our festival anyway, explaining our traditions and the meanings behind them. He nodded along, seemingly very attentive. I tried to bring the conversation back to him.\n\n\"So, Drifter, where are you—\"\n\n\"Well, best be on my way!\" he said, pretending not to hear me as he backed up. \"I've taken up enough of your time—who knows how much any of us has left.\" As he walked off, he tossed back, \"Like the décor! Good colors!\" then disappeared around a corner.\n\nI've heard other people talk about this strange man. They mostly say the same things: very friendly, if a little mysterious. On the other hand, I've also heard some things I won't repeat—they're far too gruesome to be true, and I won't facilitate spreading false rumors. I'm sure his eating habits are no different from yours or mine.\n\nSuffice to say, something is off about him.

        "text": "What I have loved most since coming back to the Tower is reconnecting with everyone. I missed my friends while I was away, and I thought about them every day. Even when you're doing what you know is right, it can be hard not to wish for times past.\n\nI've wanted so much to catch up on everything I missed, but these Guardians are so busy, always flitting in and out. You can barely get a word out of them most of the time. I feel like so much has happened, but I get only drips of information.\n\n\"Spider\" is a name I hear over and over, but who is he? A common criminal? A deity? A friend? Some accounts paint him as all three. What is it about this Spider fellow that compels these Guardians so?\n\nAnd do I have it right that he feeds on Ghosts? Ghosts! What an utterly despicable practice. Even the most detestable Ghost doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. (Yes, I am thinking of one in particular, but… I'm afraid old Eva will keep that secret to herself.)\n\nFrom what I can put together, this Spider fellow had a group of Barons, I think. If that's correct, his relationship with them seemed… tenuous. I don't know what one gets up to on this Tangled Shore, but I think he had them all killed.\n\nBefore that, though, Spider's Barons broke into some kind of high-security prison out in space. They were looking for… something belonging to Spider. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was Ghosts or maybe it was weapons—although why he'd have someone look for those things in a prison, I don't know. While his Barons were in there, the prisoners started to fight them. That rascal Cayde-6 was also in the prison, on a mission that I don't think was related to Spider's mission. They ended up in the same fight, though, from what it sounds like. Then, while everyone was fighting, the Reef Queen's brother arrived!\n\nWhen I first heard this story, at this point I thought to myself, \"Oh, good! Finally someone on our side. The Awoken Prince will help get things in order.\" Now, keep in mind that I had always heard he was… a bit stiff. But also that he was willing to help when it came down to it. That was before his sister, though. Loss can do terrible, ugly things to us.\n\nThis leads me to the only detail I know with absolute certainty: Uldren Sov killed Cayde-6.\n \nI don't know why, but I suspect it was in part because the Prince succumbed to the pain in his heart and lost the ability to see things as they are. Anyway, once Spider's Barons left the prison, they ran all over the Reef. I guess they had found what Spider was looking for, but decided to keep those things for themselves. This Spider sent people after the Barons, and I don't think any of the Barons survived.\n\nWhile all this was going on, someone killed Uldren. I assume it was revenge for Cayde, but I can't get anyone to tell me with certainty who did it. Based on everything else I hear about this Spider, I wonder if Uldren wasn't also his work.\n\nMany of my Guardian friends are still doing favors for this… creature who, at best, betrays his own people. I am not sure that road leads anywhere good. Though perhaps I don't have the whole truth.\n\nThis is no history lesson. Take it however you will. Some people just don't have time to talk to old Eva, it seems.\n\n---\n\nCandy Dead Ghosts:\nMix Dark Ether Cane and Flash of Inspiration, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "What are the Awoken?\n\nNot in the sense of \"how did they come to be?\" I don't care about that any more than about how the Cabal or the Fallen came to be. As far as I'm concerned, the universe decided it wanted them, and so it made them. Who am I to question the universe?\n\nI've heard people talk about Petra Venj and the Tangled Shore lately. It's very confusing—roped-together rocks? And you just… jump between them? It's no wonder that Reefborn Awoken are so often suspicious of others if they grow up unable to even trust the ground!\n\nBut the Awoken as a whole… I feel like my grasp of them has certainly grown, but there are things I still don't understand. They are certainly part of what we consider \"humanity,\" just as much as Humans or Exos. I know this and believe it, but what makes it so?\n\nIs it because they are… made… like we are? The Cabal are built roughly as we are, but we do not consider them part of humanity.\n\nIs it our shared relationship with the Traveler? As hard as it is to believe, I have heard the Fallen had a relationship with the Traveler. But they are not part of humanity. \n\nDoes \"humanity\" consider only those who choose to walk among Humans? But by that logic, Reefborn Awoken who remain in the Reef are not part of humanity. I don't believe that's true, and yet…\n\nPetra has spent most of her life in the Reef, hasn't she? I know she was here playing Emissary for a while, but she has always considered the Reef her true home. Would she describe herself as part of humanity? I think if you walked up to Petra and asked, \"Are you a member of humanity?\" she would respond, \"I am an Awoken of the Reef.\" If you pressed her further and asked, \"Yes, but which side are you on?\" I believe she would say, \"The side of Queen Mara Sov.\"\n\nSo then is humanity something we choose? Or is it ascribed to you? Is it a title to be earned or a birthright, a heritage? Are the Awoken part of humanity due to one of these stipulations, or—\n\nCould it be that the Awoken are part of humanity because of ALL of these stipulations? Individually, these ideas don't define humanity any more than a cloak defines a Hunter, but COLLECTIVELY—that they are built as we are, that they share our relationship with the Traveler, and that many of them gladly walk among us here on Earth… Maybe THAT is what makes them part of humanity—everything bound together, just as we are all bound together.\n\nThat togetherness is what helped us win the Red War, and I truly believe it will help us push back the Darkness for good. Never forget that our unity is what makes us strong, and the Awoken will always be part of that.\n\n---\n\nIll-Fortune Cookies:\nMix Dark Ether Cane and Impossible Heat, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

        "text": "There is a strange fellow who… well, perhaps you've seen him. He doesn't really come and go as you or I might traditionally think. It's more that you turn around, and he is either there or he is not. His appearances are steady and predictable, at least. He's called Xûr. I'm not sure why one draws the tiny arrow over his name, but it's important to try and respect the wishes of those we don't understand.\n\nThe first time I ever saw Xûr, I was by myself at my stall in the Tower. The Old Tower, I suppose you'd call it now. I hadn't been there long at all. I looked up, and this man had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere! His back was to me, but even from behind, something seemed off about him. Something in his posture. As he started to turn, I noticed his whole face appeared to be covered in hair. It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its own—but there was no wind.\n\nWhen the light hit his face, I screamed and ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done for.\n\nEventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was going about their business. No one was panicking but me! Many people saw him—several were interacting with him.\n\nSlowly, I stood back up and tried to go about my business—though I rarely looked away. Tess came over before too long, and I asked her about the strange figure.\n\n\"Oh, that's Xûr!\" she said, unconcerned. \"He comes through every so often and sells particular, hard-to-find things.\" She considered him for a moment, then added, \"Could do with a bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he's otherwise harmless.\"\n\n\"What is he?\" I asked. \"I've never seen a creature like that before.\"\n\n\"Xûr is… I believe he's called a Jovian. They're from out beyond even the Reef. I'm afraid I don't know much else about them.\"\n\n\"But they're… friendly?\"\n\n\"Well, they don't attack us, if that's what you mean. I don't know that I'd call Xûr friendly, but he's not hostile.\"\n\nI felt more at ease after our conversation, though I still could not shake my fear. For many months, I jumped every time I saw him and had to fight back the instinct to hide.\n\nEventually, I grew used to his presence. I even began to appreciate his predictability—it became a symbol that everything was functioning as it should. The fear evaporated with time.\n\nI have often found that my first reaction to new things is fear. Perhaps it is this way for everyone. However, I have also found that if I accept and acknowledge my fear, it is easier to push through until I am no longer afraid. The new thing has almost never been as frightening as I first feared.\n\n---\n\nStrange Cookies:\nMix Taken Butter and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake."

I know that his theories divided the Tower, civilians and Guardians alike, and I've seen that division spring up in strange places, even years after Osiris left to pursue his radical research.\n\nHere is a joke for you, my friend:\n\nA follower of Osiris and a skeptic sit down at a table to work out their differences. They die there.\n\nDon't ask me where I heard that. But don't be surprised—if you think the people of the City don't poke fun at you Guardians now and again, you're not paying attention.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI heard rumors about Brother Vance, one of Osiris's followers. The rumors started like myths: how he might use the knowledge discovered by Osiris to perform miracles or to raise Guardians to their full potential. Then, for a reason I couldn't see myself, the rumors changed: Vance was a fanatic unacquainted with Osiris, left waiting endlessly on the sands of Mercury for something that would never come.\n\nGuardians are so full of action. I think they couldn't empathize with such passivity.\n\nAs for me, I think we should believe in things and people we can see for ourselves. What someone does now is better proof of their spirit than what they are fabled to have done. It seems to me that waiting forever for your hero to return, poring over the same books and letters, relying on a hope for the future you cannot control… well. I see it as wasted time.\n\nThen, I tend toward action myself. Busy hands, busy mind.\n\nBut I also think it must be lonely and disheartening to be abandoned by your idol, even if that abandonment exists only in your own mind. I imagine a man like Vance holds a lonely vigil. I think, perhaps, he knows what people say about him, and he tries to lift himself above it—and drives himself further into isolation.\n\nBut then, I've never met him. I don't know which rumors are true and which are silly gossip. I only know that the Dawning welcomes everyone—especially those who feel the most isolated."

As with many of the stories I hear from Guardians, I marveled that such a thing could be real.\n\nI remember, in particular, an Awoken Warlock named Nadya, who came to visit me in the way many Guardians do: quiet, sheepish, hoping for tea.\n\nI always welcome them in for a cup, of course.\n\nThat day, Nadya sat at my table with her untouched cup of tea. If I hadn't already spent so much time cheering people up in my kitchen, I might have pressed her, but I knew better. I waited. Eventually, she looked up at me.\n\n\"I feel like I found a piece of myself and then lost it, all at once,\" Nadya said, soft and sad. \"I know Guardians aren't meant to look to their heritage beyond the Traveler, but the Dreaming City felt like…\" She trailed off.\n\n\"Home?\" I said.\n\nNadya lowered her eyes. \"Yes. Like home.\" She was quiet, and then looked at me again. \"Is that wrong?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Of course not. Home is not always a single place, you know. I've had many homes.\"\n\nNadya nodded and pushed her tea cup around on the table, distracted. This time, I had to wait a while before she would speak again. Eventually, she said, \"I feel like I'm mourning the loss of something I never really had.\"\n\nI don't fully understand the curse that plagues the Awoken homeland. I know that it came about through great misunderstanding and peril. I know that Uldren Sov and another creature I have never heard of were at the center of that peril. But, from what I hear, there were no clear enemies in that story. No single place to lay blame.\n\nThat can make it so much harder to accept.\n\nNadya's heartbreak was tangible. I felt it in my own heart. But, even as I saw her suffering, I also saw Nadya stand up and go back to her work. She returned to the Dreaming City, week after week.\n\nI think we are not defined by our successes, but by our ability to keep fighting when the fight seems unwinnable. Not just Guardians.

I watch the ships coming in, and the birds, and the clouds—I get so busy that it helps to step away for a little while and remind myself of what's outside. The other day, I was sitting on this bench when a very tall Titan stepped up beside me, his hands folded in front of him.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am,\" he said. \"Would you mind if I sit here?\"\n\nI smiled and shifted over to make room. \"Please,\" I said. He sat. His shoulders were so broad that I had to shift over a little more.\n\nHe had a bag of birdseed with him, and I watched as he spread a little of it on the ground. The pigeons came quickly—in fact, I'd noticed a few more than usual the instant he sat down. I wondered to myself how often he came here and how we'd managed to miss each other thus far. He was not an easy man to miss.\n\nThe cooing of the pigeons and the far-off bustle of the City were soothing, and seeing as the gentleman seemed to have no trouble with companionable silence, I closed my eyes. After a moment, though, I was aware of footsteps and whispering behind us. A young woman, another Titan, came up to the bench and said to the gentleman, smiling nervously, \"It's such an honor to meet you. You're an inspiration to Titans everywhere.\"\n\nHe nodded humbly. \"Thank you,\" he said. They spoke briefly. He asked her name. They talked about how she'd just come back from being stationed on Io for patrol duty. He commended her commitment to keeping the people of the system safe, and then she and her friends left.\n\nMy companion went back to feeding the pigeons. After a moment, I asked him, mostly joking, \"Are you famous?\"\n\nHe glanced at me and inclined his head, hesitantly. \"A little bit.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, smiling. After a moment, I added, \"My name is Eva.\"\n\n\"Saint.\"\n\nI sat with that answer for a moment and then asked, \"Saint-14?\" I'd heard the story of how he fought for the City during the Battle of Six Fronts, so long ago, and another more fantastical story about how he'd defeated a powerful Fallen fellow by headbutting him. Anytime I heard that story, I always found myself hoping he had a good, sturdy helmet.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, spreading a little more birdseed. \"It is a pleasure to meet you, Eva.\"\n\nWe sat a little longer together, watching the pigeons and the clouds, before I finally had to excuse myself to go back to my work.\n\nAs I said, I'd heard the legend of Saint-14 before. Many legends of remarkable Guardians make them seem like mythical figures, so far removed from anything the civilians of the City will ever see or experience. The legendary Saint-14 does not seem that way to me at all.\n\nIn fact, I think he is a very nice young man."

As I'm sure you know by now, it is as rewarding to give a gift as to receive it.\n\nWhen you find yourself receiving many gifts, maybe unexpectedly, look to the giver. Have you given them anything? Gift-giving is not score-keeping, but when you are showered with luxurious gifts made of gold, engraved with your name, lavished upon you with great bouts of flattery—stop and think about why you have received them.\n\nSometimes you should question these gifts. Consider who the gift-giver has favored before. Why you? Why now? If you have no satisfying or reassuring answer to these questions, the chances are good that this gift-giver is carefully tallying your \"debts,\" and will one day move to collect them.\n\nNot all gifts are given freely.

I could see her out of the corner of my eye: still, silent, and… maybe just slightly nervous.\n\nPerhaps I imagined that.\n\nOnce I was through with the customer, I gestured for her to come over to my worktable. She did, paused a moment to watch me with my fabrics, and then asked, \"Is the Dawning a Guardian holiday?\"\n\nI smiled. I knew from some of my regulars—the sort that were inclined to gossip—that Ada was new to the traditions of the City.\n\n\"The Dawning is for everyone,\" I said. \"Everyone in the City and beyond it, if they would like to celebrate.\"\n\nShe was quiet a moment, considering. I could not tell whether she was shy or just one of those solitary people who prefer silence. I let her be, either way. Eventually, she turned as if to leave, and then paused to look at me again.\n\n\"I have seen your patterns,\" she said. \"Your color schemes for this holiday. I have some ideas, if you would ever like to hear them.\"\n\nSurprised, I asked for her thoughts right away. I quickly learned that she has an impeccable sense for color and design. She didn't care to overtake the project of designing shaders for the Dawning, but she acted as a quiet and talented consultant. Over the next week or so, we spent many hours together sorting through rolls of fabric, comparing colors, considering combinations. While I think she remained wary of growing too chummy, I like to believe she started to warm to me—and to the idea of becoming a part of a long-standing City tradition.\n\nI know very little about Ada, except that she lived through the Dark Age. Those were harrowing times. Guardians then were not what they are today.\n\nLiving through times of peril can affect us in many different ways. Sometimes those experiences change us for the better, and sometimes they don't. After all she experienced, Ada made a way of life for herself that suits her, and she has slowly begun to reconcile that life with the lives she sees being lived here, in the Tower and the City. That takes courage. I admire it."

Yes, the stakes are different for a Guardian than for the rest of us—but is the emotional toll so different? How much do you rely on desensitizing yourselves to fear and trauma in order to do your essential work? Ikora tells me not to think on this. I cannot help it.\n\nI have never truly understood the Guardian Eris Morn. I like to plant myself firmly in the now, in the tangible. How can I make the lives of my friends better right now? How can I bring them good cheer, or good conversation, or good food? In the past, I have found Eris to be the opposite of this. I have, at least in my own head, accused her of being… gloomy.\n\nHowever, I have begun to think she just sees things from a very different perspective than I do. The things that she has experienced are beyond anything I can imagine, and so we see the world in different ways.\n\nSo yes, I believe Guardians and non-Guardians should live closely and try to focus on our similarities.

This is a truth we must all learn to live with.\n\nAll that said, Eris does play a part in many of our traditions, especially the Festival of the Lost. What a fuss she makes, though! The first time I asked for her help, she said to me, \"Eva, the work I am doing is essential to humanity's survival. I do not have time for a, a… party.\"\n\nI said what I always say: \"The little things will get us through just as much as the big things. Let's not allow the flowers to wilt in the pot while you're still digging the garden, Eris.\"\n\nShe never likes that. But she always agrees.\n\nAnd I think she likes taking part. I once saw her hand a box of raisins to a masked Guardian, stone-faced, and then turn around and smile. Eris! Smiling!\n\nOnce I plan a Dawning event to put her in charge of, we'll have her grinning ear to ear, I'm sure of it."

I'm not as young as I used to be, and there's an awful lot of confetti to sweep up after the celebrations die down.\n\nJust the other day, I found myself in an ill-used stairway near the Annex, carrying a box of streamers and looking for some help. At the bottom of the stairs, sweeping the same patch of clean floor, was a frame. I felt an instant sympathy for it, and then a practical annoyance. Surely we could deploy our resources better.\n\n\"I am here for maintenance,\" the frame said to me.\n\n\"You seem maintained,\" I said cheerfully. I held the box of streamers out to him. \"This room looks well-swept. Perhaps you could help me decorate the Courtyard.\"\n\nThe frame tilted its head down to look at the box. \"I am here for mmmmmmm—\" It looked up at me again. It continued to sweep, but faster. \"Mai—zzzt—this task is below—his Excellenssssss—do not engage, e-e-e-end conv—\"\n\nI watched patiently.\n\n\"His bene-ne-nevolent Majest-t-t-ty, Maje—maintenance.\" It stopped sweeping. \"I am here for maintenance.\"\n\nI 'hmmph'ed to myself, set down my box, and took the broom from the frame. I leaned the broom against the wall and picked up the box again. My back was already aching. I handed the box over and then pointed to the stairs. \"Come along with me.\"\n\nWith some coaxing, I managed to lure it to the Courtyard. I pointed to the places I wanted it to hang the streamers.\n\n\"I am here for maintenance,\" it said weakly.\n\nI left it to the work without much hope that it would get done to my standards—but one can't be choosy when one is on a deadline. Not surprisingly, when I returned, both the frame and the box of streamers were gone. Deciding to choose my battles, I let it go—and now I am even more grateful for the friendly, functioning frames in my employ."

Nobody does 'unnervingly bewildered' like our boy Xur.\" The Titan points down into the shadows of the Tower hangar, where a cloaked figure hunches over nothing, as if run through by an invisible spear. \"He comes here to trade. We didn't let him in, but we don't stop him, either.\"\n\nLavinia, as afraid of success as she is of failure, shivers through a thrill of nerves. \"Xûr,\" she corrects the Titan, then, feeling like a pedant: \"Sorry. Cryptarch habit.\"\n\n\"Right. Xur. That's what I said.\" The Titan shrugs. \"I like old stuff too, Cryptarch. Go ask your question.\"\n\nLavinia's mother told her that on the day of her birth, a witch pronounced her lucky. She will have to trust in that luck now.\n\nShe descends to the hangar floor and walks determinedly up to the thing. It does not even lift its hood to look. \"Xûr,\" she says, unsure what to do with her hands. \"I'm Cryptarch Lavinia Garcia Umr Tawil. I've chosen to study the Nine.\" As all fools do, her master told her. \"I want to ask you a question.\"\n\n\"You have no need of it.\" The voice hidden in that squirming face is a man's, low and incongruously clear. He sounds, Lavinia thinks, as if he is trying very earnestly and very hard to be understood. \"But I will give it to you.\"\n\nShe has practiced this question, clung to it as her anchor when she drifted away from her master and friends. \"We salvaged information from a Ghost on Venus, in the Ishtar Sink. It described an artifact found by our Golden Age ancestors. A copper box, painted red, lightly damaged, full of dust. On the individual motes of dust we found engraved maps of rocky worlds. Mars, Earth, Venus, other planets...maybe every Earthlike planet in the galaxy.\"\n\nXûr lifts its grasping face. She sees an almost human curiosity, but stretched over the rack of an alien shape, a provisional superstructure cobbled together to make a manlike form, ever on the verge of failure. \"Planets,\" it says. \"My motions, in large part, depend upon their configuration.\"\n\nShe doesn't shudder, much. \"My colleagues say the artifact came from the Vex, as a warning that they will exist wherever we go. But I think,\" she swallows, \"I think it's from the Nine. Did the box of dust come from the Nine, Xûr?\"\n\nXûr's golden eyes shine at her. \"I am here for a reason,\" he says. \"I cannot remember...the dust has changed. The dust is precious.\"\n\n\"Yes! Did the Nine send us the dust? Why is dust precious, Xûr?\" Why dust at all? Why not a letter, or a clay tablet, or anything clear?\n\n\"Blood,\" Xûr says, and makes a sound like a cough. \"The blood is transformed. The wish is granted. The dust is commingled.\"\n\n\"It can't be the Vex who sent it,\" she insists, as if Xûr is another stubborn Cryptarch who won't listen.\n\n(Lavinia you must stop babbling.) \"The Vex use matter as a substrate for computation, not a medium to communicate. How is it that the Nine can map the mass of every rocky planet in the galaxy, but not send us a message on the radio? Why Venus? Why dust?\"\n\n\"Much of dust was once cells,\" Xûr says, and coughs loudly. \"This dust was once of the Nine. It commingled. It was forever changed.\" That harsh, percussive cough again. \"Dust to dust. One dust to another. The Nine are the flesh of dust.\"\n\nLavinia realizes that the Agent of the Nine is laughing."

A Titan in New Monarchy red pins her to the ground; a Hunter with a gun barrel as wide as the moon cuffs her and calls her a looter.\n\n\"Rahool has a watch on this one,\" the Titan remarks, consulting her black-tipped Ghost. \"Says it's for her own protection— \"\n\nThe Hunter hisses and flinches back. \"She's got a bone!\"\n\n\"Get off of her! ENOUGH!\" This new voice is strange to Lavinia but the power in it can only be Ikora Rey's. \"You will never touch a mortal human in anger again! That is not our purpose!\"\n\nThunder booms; something detonates nearby; Lavinia's ears pop. She gets the sense that, voluntarily or otherwise, the two New Monarchy Guardians have vanished. Lavinia tries to stand up but vertigo and the cuffs pitch her sideways and she lands hard on her hip. \"Master Rey,\" she gasps, \"I'm sorry, I should've filed a—\"\n\n\"Lavinia.\" Ikora's coiled fury has a tooth of fear in it. \"Open your left hand.\"\n\nThere's a bone in her hand. A long chunk of jaw with one huge white protruding tooth. It's warm and comforting and solid. She clutches it protectively, the key, the eggtooth that will crack open the mystery of the Nine and put her back in her master's good graces and save her from the probation Rahool dropped on her when he hauled her out of the archives—\n\nWith an effort of will that makes her shout out loud, she opens her fist and drops the Ahamkara bone.\n\nIkora Rey makes it fly away. \"You weren't after that bone. It was after you. Did you make a wish, Lavinia? Did you ask to know about the Nine?\"\n\nShe tries to explain that she didn't, that she only wanted to track the bone back to its source (Venus, hopefully), and to learn why the Nine needed the Ahamkara.\n\n\"Why do you think the Nine needed Ahamkara?\" Ikora asks, dangerously.\n\n\"To make wishes,\" Lavinia pants. \"Xûr didn't appear in the Tower until the end of the Great Ahamkara Hunt. Whatever they used to get from the Ahamkara...\"\n\nShe leaves it unsaid: maybe the Nine are now getting it from Guardians.\n\nIkora rubs her brow. \"I can't stop you. But if you keep looking, I can't protect you from the consequences.\"\n\n\"Help me!\" Lavinia begs. \"There's something here! Something that connects everything, the Trials, and the Ahamkara, and the Guardians, and the Nine. There are things the Consensus knows about Ghaul's attack, things they haven't told us—\"\n\nIkora Rey puts up one finger. Lavinia shuts up. \"Choose. Are you going to go back to school, and let me pretend you were never here? Or do I have to report you for theft of an Ahamkara bone?\"\n\nLavinia takes a deep breath. \"I'm sorry,\" she says. \"I have to keep going.

Endless revels light up the purple sky; people leap off the world and drift away into the artificial atmosphere, to be collected, protesting woozily, by the skiffload.\n\nLavinia is a wallflower here, forever on the edge of things. She gets pangs of homesickness every night, and tells herself that the Reef is the right place to begin her journey home. This meeting, right now, might be the first step...\n\n\"Much mourning,\" the Fallen at her side murmurs. \"Master Ives murdered, Variks missing. Spider hires away my friends. Well, I stay to guard Master Ives's work. You come in, make yourself into a home. I will bring nitrogen tea and records.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Lavinia wants to laugh, or maybe cry, at the malapropism. If only she could make herself into a home! But it'll be all right in the end. She will find the Nine, bring the truth home, and earn forgiveness.\n\nThe Fallen returns with tea and devices. \"Watch. Record from Prison of Elders. Master Ives fascinated by it.\"\n\nShe sees Skolas, fallen Kell of Fallen Kells, waiting to die by combat. His huge horned armor lags his motions, like a weary companion trying to mimic everything he does. A servitor pumps ether into him. Lavinia wonders what would happen if she took Ether. Would she feel clearly and coldly determined? Would she turn into a huge Lavinia? Would she stop missing her home?\n\n\"Mara.\" Skolas's mouth was not made for that name. \"Mara, do you hear?\"\n\n\"The Queen of the Reef sentenced him to the fate of all Fallen,\" Lavinia's companion sighs. \"To strive, and struggle, and fail. But he was already lost. His mind broke at the Citadel, where he saw into time.\"\n\nSkolas blows white vapor. Frost crackles on his mask. \"You gifted me to the Nine. And they sent me back. People think you are a fool. That you made an error releasing me. Led your people to die on my blade, as I led my people to die on yours.\"\n\nLavinia's translator murmurs along with the Kell's words. \"The Nine's agent never told me why he released me. Now I know. You know also, I think. Both of you require the Guardians... and the Nine do not understand life and death. So they sent me back to you, to make the Guardians come. They did not comprehend the harm.\n\n\"I do not comprehend them either. I traveled among the Jovians for years, in their dominion. But I do not know the Nine. You, Mara Sov... you are the only one who bargains with them. You are the only one who has foreseen their role in the game. You keep your successes secret, so the world only knows your mistakes. No wonder I underestimated you.\"\n\nHe hefts the scorch cannon his jailers have given him. Lavinia thinks of the tools his House once favored: shuttle and loom. \"I saw the shape of the Nine on Venus. A place that was once precious to them, where wishes could transfigure their flesh. I saw that they are bound to this star and to these worlds. You are of a kind in that way, you and the Nine. Not I. I will be glad to leave this world, Mara Sov. I am tired of being a pawn.\"\n\nSkolas lays his huge horned head back against the cell wall.\n\nLavinia, watching, spills her tea in excitement. \"They want to help us,\" she whispers. \"They're from our planets! They want to help! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so clumsy—\"\n\nShe leans down to mop up the spilled tea. A flashbang grenade detonates in her face. The next thing she knows an Awoken officer is sentencing her, under martial law, to life in prison for espionage.\n\nLavinia, fumbling for any sign of her good luck, is glad to see the Fallen go free."

She was terrified of Cabal during the occupation, and now she is going into battle against them, but she is not afraid.\n\n\"This is exciting,\" she whispers to the Royal Guard at her side, as the ship plummets stern-first toward the Cabal Leviathan. \"Don't you think?\"\n\nThe Royal Guard's jaw twitches. Either she is subvocalizing in code, or chewing her tongue off before she insults Paladin Kamala Rior's honored guest.\n\n\"Three minutes to closest approach,\" the flight dynamics officer calls. \"INCO, target emissions status?\"\n\n\"The Leviathan is illuminating us with targeting sensors. No change.\"\n\nPaladin Rior pulls Lavinia out of her nook. \"Miss Umr Tawil, please come observe the instruments with me.\"\n\n\"Do you do this a lot?\" Lavinia wants to impress Paladin Rior, who sprung her from jail because, in her words, \"every brain in the Reef is busy thinking about one problem, so I need your brain for another.\" Lavinia doesn't want to let her down. \"Step on the tiger's tail with these... fly-bys?\"\n\n\"Shows of force,\" Kamala corrects her. \"We need Calus to believe that we're prepared to meet his ship with our own fleet. And if we can investigate other mysteries along the way, like your theory about the Nine, then all the better. Here, now. This is the device you requested. Please observe.\"\n\nKamala shows her a pane of black glass, illuminated by a faint purple fuzz that sweeps left to right. Lavinia touches it in awe. \"That's dark matter?\"\n\n\"Correct.\" Every schoolchild knows that most mass in the universe is dark matter; but it is nothing more than mass, and it never forms structures smaller than a galactic halo. Dark matter has no charge, passes through itself, never gathers into clumps, and has no chemistry. It is only ever dust.\n\n\"If you're right...\" Kamala draws in a breath. \"Any moment...\"\n\n\"Drive field error!\" the flight officer calls. \"Minor perturbation on the leading edge. We are encountering unexpected mass groups. No corresponding radar or lidar contacts.\"\n\nThe black screen of the dark matter detector explodes into frenzied purple-white shapes, like the webs of a spider locked in sensory deprivation for a million billion years. Thick cords of shadowstuff that twine into strangling arms which branch again into thousands of tiny fingers that pierce—\n\n—straight through the Cabal Leviathan.\n\n\"Oh my,\" Lavinia breathes. \"That's the dark matter we're passing through?\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\n\"And this is unusual? This level of structure?\"\n\n\"Miss Tawil,\" Kamala says, \"a single molecule of dark matter would be unusual. This is blasphemous excess. This is impossibility.\"\n\nNo, Lavinia thinks. This is the Nine. They're looking at Calus. They're reaching out. These are their hands...\n\n\"We should've thought to use this sensor earlier,\" Kamala muses. \"Our Queen invented it to assist navigation when we were losing ships near Rhea. A phaeton backscatter scan. Very clever. Everything she did seems to make sense, eventually; she was so very far-sighted. No one else ever bargained with the Nine as an equal, did they? No one will ever know what good she did for them... our Queen of secrets.\"\n\n\"I have to contact the City!\" Lavinia fumbles for some way to get a capture of the screen, a picture of the Nine, but she doesn't have her tablet. \"I found them!\"\n\n\"Ah. About that.\" Rior's armored hand falls on her shoulder. \"The Queen's edict also forbids me from disclosing the Reef's knowledge of the Nine to individuals without REGAL clearance. So. Thank you for your assistance, Miss Tawil. Take her back to her cell.\"\n\nIf anyone ever calls her Lucky Lavinia again, she thinks she might shoot them."

I have to run.\"\n\n\"That wasn't the deal!\" Lavinia shouts, pacing in front of a humming portal. \"You break me out, you bring me here, and you carry my findings to the City!

Shouldn't have paid in advance, Cryptarch.\"\n\nThe channel disintegrates into digital static as the Corsair's ship accelerates away.\n\nLavinia swears and beats her suited fist against her helmet. She's trapped in Cocytus! The last time the Awoken trapped anyone here, those poor souls went utterly insane. The doomed crew of the Dead Orbit scout ship Sophia called this place A113, an innocent catalogue number; they had no idea that the gates aboard—once a Golden Age experiment—had been captured by the Hive deity Crota. Those gates consumed them all.\n\nNow Crota is gone, and Lavinia has gambled everything that the portals have fallen into other hands. Ahamkara make the unreal real—Calus's ship is surrounded by a halo of unreal dark matter, like a ring of probing hands, Guardians can manipulate reality itself—there is a pattern here, a story, and it leads to Cocytus, to what these gates might do.\n\n\"Logs.\" She pages frantically through the observations left by the Awoken sentries once stationed here. Cocytus was abandoned when the Red Legion attacked, all its defenses scavenged to reinforce Vesta. \"What came out of the gate? What did you see?\"\n\n//EVENT 1 TIME 00:00:00 Portal 3 emitted a hydrogen nucleus. Over 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15, the gate emitted tar containing complex monomers and polymers—\n\n\"Come on!\" Lavinia barks, paging ahead. \"Come on, damn you, give me something real! Give me the Nine!\"\n\n//EVENT 1 TIME 524:03:11 Portal 3 emitted a living organism. Death was immediate. Autopsy team reports a spherical body, radius one point one meters, surfaced in hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body consists of an undifferentiated tissue of primitive cells. A basic spasm reflex forces air down the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\nLavinia reads this again, horrified and fascinated. Something on the far side of the gate is learning to assemble atoms, molecules, even haphazard life... something from a world of darkness and dust, probing its way into our structured existence, trying to cobble together a message, an emissary, a body...\n\nThe Nine are on the far side of this gate. She's sure of it. She's found them.\n\nBut to meet the Nine directly... would that be madness? Would there be any return? Would she ever see the City again?\n\nShe's come so far for her truth.\n\nAn alarm sounds in her helmet. INCOMING TRANSMAT, the suit warns her. INCOMING TRANSMAT. Her radio barks at her, stern as Ikora Rey: \"Cryptarch Lavinia Garcia Umr Tawil.\" It's Paladin Rior. \"You stand in violation of the Queen's law. Surrender yourself, and you will be treated fairly.\"\n\nLavinia stares into the yawning gate. Beyond it lies a realm of utter darkness and dissolution, a place where nothing exists except the most alien forms. To go there would be suicide. She would die like the poor tarball creature.\n\nBut what lies behind her? Failure? Surrender? Shame? A life in a cell?\n\n\"Lucky Lavinia,\" she says, and leaps through."

It is the hardest thing in the universe for the dust to make a loop at all, because, like a gust of wind or a river, it was only meant to move one way. For a mind to function, the end of one thought must alter the beginning of the next: so, like rivers, like wind, the Nine could not have minds until they could make loops.\n\nLavinia Garcia Umr Tawil comprehends the Nine.\n\nThey were already ancient when the first human beings named themselves. Their flesh was older than stars: the dark dust wind that blows through the galaxy, pinched by the gravity of Sol and its planets, drawn into their cores and exhaled again.\n\nThese were the Nine.\n\nIn time loops did form. Great arcs of outbound dust collapsed back to their sources to create circuits of shadow. The thickening and thinning of these circuits were the first thoughts of the Nine. They dwelt in massive indifference, unborn primordial gods. There was no force among them except gravity; no structure except the distribution of mass. Their hearts were in the cores of worlds, but their farthest streams faded out into the turn of the galaxy.\n\nThey were the fountains of Achlys, the night before chaos.\n\nBut life arose on the worlds at the heart of the Nine, tiny complicated motions of ecosystems and metabolisms and computations. That life left mass-shadows in the wind of the Nine, plucking at them like harp strings. From these trembles of structure the Nine learned to seed enormous resonating waves, thoughts vaster than worlds.\n\nSo the Nine awoke. And in time they understood that they were as fragile as they were mighty; for if the life that seeded their thoughts ever passed away, they too would vanish.\n\nThey had no eyes to catch light. They had no ears to hear. And yet they turned their wills upon the alien world of Matter, and strove to learn, for they knew they had to protect their hearts, or die.\n\nWith a horror of revelation so absolute that it would drive her mad if she still had sanity to lose, Lavinia understands where the Nine have always been. They are within everyone, every system, every living and moving thing. Trillions and pentillions of slim dark matter tentacles plunged through all our bodies, drinking up the complexity of our lives and thoughts.\n\nWe are all pinched silhouettes impaled on the twitchings of infinitely long spiderlegs."

They could gain forces beyond Gravity to structure themselves, and so become more than wraiths of dark dust. They could enter the mad alien superworld of our chemical reality.\n\nSo they turned to this new hope... and were divided.\n\n\"Come to me,\" a voice calls to Lavinia, although there is nowhere to go, nothing to be, not even emptiness but the absence of anything to be empty or full. Lavinia perceives, without emotion, that she now exists as a structure of dark dust, a sandstorm blowing against itself.\n\n\"Come,\" the voice calls. \"I am Nasya. You are not safe. Come with me.\"\n\nNot safe?\n\nNo. Of course she is not safe. Because there are factions among the Nine: one faction sent Xûr and Orin to study Guardians and the Light, to seek the secret of effect-without-cause and to protect the source of that secret, the last source, now that the Ahamkara are gone. Those five played at alchemy with the Cocytus gates, turning dark dust into energy and then into matter, but they could not unlock the secrets of our mad existence. They needed ambassadors. Go-betweens.\n\nThe other faction walks a different path. A path of folds and needles slipped through spacetime itself, existential syringes yielding new spaces, to be remade as the Nine desire. They have tried to gather enough dark dust in one place to form a black hole, and found it difficult: when the dark mass collapses in gravity's fist, the dust passes through itself and scatters.\n\nBut difficult is not impossible. And there is far, far more dark matter in the universe than bright. They will find a way to make new worlds of it. They will end their dependence on life, and on the Light of Guardians, which the falling veil will soon snuff out forever...\n\nIn passing, Lavinia sees the entire history of the Queen's interactions with the Nine: more than anyone suspected, and more vital. She sees how one of the Nine blinded Guardians to Ghaul's approach, risking everything (for Ghaul would have destroyed the sun, and the Nine with it) to learn how to steal the Light. She sees how that one was punished.\n\n\"Come!\" Nasya calls, urgently. \"Come with me! Come quickly, before—\"\n\nSomething dark and hypodermic pierces the void beneath Lavinia and slurps her down, pulls her through a proboscis so tiny that it breaks her apart into a stream of single particles, one after another. She is annihilated...\n\n... and reborn, somewhere, somewhen, made of flesh again, shaking and dripping fear-sweat, mewling like a little baby. Her cheek presses against a warm wooden floor. There's a fireplace, and a fire in it, and strong wind outside that sucks at the flames.\n\nThe clever-looking old lady at the desk looks up. \"Ah,\" she says. \"Lavinia! You made it.\"\n\n\"Wh—\" Lavinia gasps. \"Wha—\"\n\nShe smiles, as if Lavinia's confusion is the sweetest greeting she's ever heard. \"Don't be afraid. You've come to exactly the right place.\"\n\n\"Where...?\"\n\n\"Someplace where you're appreciated. Where we can really use everything you've learned.\" The old lady pours a thin stream of tea into a cup of bone. \"Didn't I tell you that you were lucky, back when you were born?\""

Fallen armed forces continue to fall back from active fronts across Terra. Factions of House Dusk remain active in the European Dead Zone. Throughout the rest of the globe, refugee attack incidents have dropped by more than 70% since the conclusion of the Red War—largely attributable to depressed Fallen and human populations rather than any significant change in interspecies relations.\n\n2. In absence of any united leadership, House Dusk continues to splinter and radicalize.\n\nThe recent trending emergence of so-called \"crime syndicates\" (cf. report #004-FALLEN-SIV) is emblematic of the continuing destructuralization of Fallen society. Likely an artifact of multi-generational colonization of human strongholds, this agent believes that because these syndicates have no relation to indigenous Fallen culture, young Fallen are appropriating and imitating human mythology in absence of a strong cultural heritage of their own.\n\nMuch like the dissolution of the Kell/Archon theology, this is positive news for those interested in the complete extirpation of invasive Fallen from the system.\n\n3. That being said, we should continue to monitor reunification efforts. Several personalities have emerged as potential leaders. First, the would-be integrationists:\n\nVIP #1121, well-known to Guardians of the inner system as Variks, or Variks the Loyal. Directly responsible for the release of the murderer Uldren Sov from the Prison of Elders, #1121 subsequently fled Awoken holdings in the Reef and now styles himself the Kell of Kells, still representing House Judgement. The Praxic Order has petitioned the Vanguard for permission to detain #1121. The Awoken monarchy, acting through the Queen's Wrath, has claimed jurisdiction over #1121 and further stated that any prosecution in absence of their involvement will be considered an act of war. The Vanguard has not yet made a statement about their position on the issue.\n\nVIP #3987, another former confederate of the Awoken, is a lesser-known personality known as Mithrax. Scattered field reports suggest that like #1121, #3987 styles himself a Kell of the so-called \"House Light,\" an otherwise unknown House apparently founded by #3987 himself. We have secondhand accounts that Mithrax has engaged in allied operations with Guardians in the field, though we have not as yet been able to corroborate these accounts with any degree of veracity. This agent is inclined to treat these reports with a healthy degree of skepticism until otherwise confirmed, as they may be propaganda from Fallen sympathizers in the Old Russian and Red War Guardian cohorts. We have requested intelligence records from the Awoken which may further clarify the matter.\n\nIn addition, whatever the findings of said intelligence records may be, it should be stressed that one or two sympathetic outliers cannot be relied upon to erase the wrongs of past centuries, nor should their good-faith efforts to correct the sins of their forebears be taken as sufficient symbolic reparation.\n\nSecond, the would-be separatists:\n\nVIP #4503, a recent personality known as Fikrul, or the Fanatic. A close confederate of the murderer Uldren Sov, #4503 has the apparent ability to raise himself from the dead in a manner not dissimilar to Ghost-aided resurrection. Though his reign on the Tangled Shore was limited, he possesses sufficient skill, hatred, and motive to warrant on-going surveillance. Given #4503's propensity for resurrection, the inherent risk of #4503 reclaiming the body of the murderer Uldren Sov from his final resting place in the Dreaming City goes without saying. The Vanguard continues to deploy fireteams to suppress #4503; our agents have reached out to the Cryptarchy and the Gensym Scribes to request guidance as to his permanent destruction.\n\nVIP #2029, a once-known personality known as Eramis, or Eramis, the Shipstealer. A House Devils Baroness incarcerated during the Wolf Wars, #2029 successfully fled the Prison of Elders during the mass escape orchestrated by #1121. #2029 is a classical Fallen pirate of the old ways: vicious, uncompromising, and possessing cunning of the highest degree. Field reports indicate that she is rallying violent dissidents to reconstruct House Devils from the ground up. This agent believes her to be the most viable candidate for universal Fallen reunification, and would urge the Vanguard and other interested leadership to aggressively prioritize her destruction.\n\nWe have come too far to pull our punches now.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

Following the events of the Red War and the recent loss of the Hunter Vanguard, current acting Vanguard leadership has struggled to define its function and role within what is an otherwise largely egalitarian and self-governing body of active Guardians. Much like the current popular perception of the Awoken queen, we have failed to adequately respond to questions about our integrity, competence, and unity as we have grieved the loss of the Hunter Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard was never intended as a governing body of authoritarians, nor does it function as such, but in times of turmoil and uncertainty, people rightly look to figures of strength for guidance and support. Neither the Titan Vanguard nor I ever intended to become politicians. We are warriors, first and foremost, and we no longer feel that we are able to serve as such.\n\nIn the spirit of honest self-reflection in the face of justified skepticism, we have begun to discuss the possibility of stepping down to invite new leadership into our place, as well as the general merits of disbanding the Vanguard entirely—largely because we believe that this crisis of identity will plague anyone who steps into this role. We recognize that this is ill-timed, and we will endeavor to involve the Consensus, the Guardians themselves, and all other interested parties in the discussion as appropriate. I specifically invite the Hidden to closely monitor the situation without my involvement. Should you agree that we are doing more harm than good, please do not hesitate to take whatever actions you agree are necessary.\n\n2. Regarding the open Hunter Vanguard position and the terms of Cayde's Dare: The situation is unprecedented. Were we to trace the chain of culpability back to its first link, I believe we would be obligated to elect a Hive god to our council.\n\nOur current inclination is to caucus with the Hunters to debate the benefits of opening the position to any interested and well-qualified Hunter. Such a debate is, of course, contingent upon the continued existence of the Vanguard itself. We will make an effort to convene the Hunters as soon as possible, but this group should be well aware that most credible candidates have fled the Tower in anticipation of such a debate.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

We are maintaining our containment posture at Cocytus. I assess no immediate danger to the system, and we have enough firepower to destroy the station and its mechanisms remotely if the on-site warheads fail. The station remains in the stable heliocentric orbit where it was parked after the destruction of Ceres.\n\n2. I do not ask confirmation of these theories, and in fact I beg you not to address them. But I have reviewed the site records, and the fate of the Sophia's crew after they were herded to Cocytus stinks of Hive madness. The Cocytus apertures must—at the time—have opened into a Hive manifold associated with Crota. Whatever their original purpose, when Crota established his presence in the system, they became conduits into hell... and the Sophia crew's ugly end proved it. Whoever drove the Sophia to its doom then installed the Cocytus Instruments around the original Golden Age facility to study Crota's manifold.\n\n3. Crota is dead. His hold on these gates has passed. Now something else is trying to pass through into our world... but it is so alien, and its sendings so bafflingly malformed, that I fear this can only end in madness.\n\n4. The first \"visitors\" through the third gate, at event time 00:00:00, were simple hydrogen atoms. Over the course of 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, we received our first macroscopic visitor, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15 the gate vomited tar containing increasingly complex monomers and polymers.\n\n5. The visitors then began to assume geometric form. A hail of cubes and hexagons, each built from molecular crystal of the same form as the whole. A series of fractal shapes that shattered under internal flaws. Several capsules or membranes of increasingly complex structure, containing water or oil. These may have been cellular precursors.\n\n6. At 524:03:11 a living organism appeared. Death was immediate. Remote dissection describes a spherical body, radius approximately one meter, surfaced in thick hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body exhibited undifferentiated tissue of primitive plantlike cells, capable of spasming to pump air or fluid in and out of the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, or internal structure to dispose of waste, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred almost instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n7. At 690:29:54 the gate emitted a tubular organism. For ninety seconds the organism moved across the gate chamber by contracting and expanding, then expired. Remote dissection describes a two-meter-long body with a spinal cavity full of energy-rich carbohydrate fluid. The organism's contractions forced this fluid through a capillary network, where simple cells catabolized the carbohydrates into energy to power further contractions. The buildup of heat and waste quickly denatured the enzymes required for metabolism, and the organism died. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n8. The gate has remained inactive since, barring short emissions of molecules which may be experimental proteins. Remote drones have registered similar ambient molecules within the Hellmouth on Luna, though we have been unable to identify their source. We will maintain the quarantine until otherwise instructed.\n\nThe overwhelming impression I have is one of learning, of increasing sophistication in the synthesis and arrangement of matter. The atoms in these structures were isotopically pure and impossible to date, but I have the uncomfortable sense that even they were freshly made.\n\n9. Probes and instruments dispatched through the third gate do not return. Annihilation is apparently immediate, and so total that it seems to result from a fundamental failure of the ability to exist rather than any weapon or countermeasure. Yet something does exist on the far side, and it is trying to learn the rules of our world from very first principles. I do not eagerly anticipate its next creation.\n\nSENSITIVE!! – CONTENTS ABOVE SNIFFED FROM REEF DATACOMS – SENSITIVE!!\n\nCf. reports #3209-3211-LUNA-HEL\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

Everybody's favorite conspiracy theorist is publishing again. Here's an excerpt from his latest paper—incomplete, I'm afraid, but you try for hi-def OCR at 500m during a rainstorm and tell me how you do.\n\n2. ...remain major unanswered questions about the failure of the City's information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network to detect the approaching Red Legion fleet.\n\nIt is by now well accepted that the Red Legion's sophistication in military affairs vastly exceeded our own. Although Ghaul's campaign made no real provision for continued resistance after the Traveler was contained and the Almighty moved into firing position, his opening gambit achieved a level of strategic surprise that would be the envy of any ancient general. Psion electronic warfare units compromised the City's sensor perimeters and suppressed our satellite early warning systems (so thoroughly that they even maintained their failsafe signals until the last possible moment). An extraordinary deception program in the Prison of Elders, combined with relativistic projectile strikes against key sensors, blinded the Reef to a simultaneous attack.\n\nBut how did the Red Legion escape the notice of the entire scattered Dead Orbit fleet? It would be politically unwise to suggest that the Arachs withheld information so their precious ships would be spared a losing battle... and indeed, the integrity of that same fleet proved invaluable in the counterattack and the city's reconstruction. It would be even more politically incendiary to suggest that the Future War Cult viewed the City's brief occupation as politically useful (or, more charitably, as a necessary step towards some desirable future timeline).\n\nBut it is impossible not to ask: how did the same Guardians who foresaw Oryx in prophecy (and in captured enemy material) fail to anticipate and take measures against the Red Legion attack? Is there something intrinsically more secular, and thus unforeseeable, about the Cabal? Do they practice superior information security to the Hive—unlikely, given the interception of a Cabal distress signal in the wake of the Taken War?\n\nDid some agency, henceforth unknown, act to conceal Ghaul's approach from our protectors? One that shared with Ghaul some central motive—whether the destruction of the Guardians, the capture of the Traveler, or the apprehension by force of the abilities we call the Light?\n\nIf such an agency exists, capable of such totality and subtlety in its action, how has it concealed itself from us?\n\n3. If I didn't know better, I'd say we had a leak. Hassan's a real ringer. Hope he gets rezzed as one of us when he dies.\n\n4. With all the usual regret, I'm going to forward a recommendation to the Cryptarchs to continue rejecting his submissions from legitimate publications. If anyone disagrees, just give a shout.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

As you all know, an unknown sender delivered six messages to VIP #2014. These missives were sent via Glimmer, using a simple encryption scheme that even a 55-30 unit Frame could have easily cracked. #2014's Ghost took immediate notice of these messages and quietly forwarded them on to IKO-006, who then distributed them back to us. Cf. reports #167-173-VESTA-DC for full transcripts.\n\n2. In these messages, the sender briefly purports to be none other than one ERI-223, providing fanciful details regarding her origins as a human woman who grew up in an apparent settlement of Old Russia known as St. Petersburg. None of this account sat well with anyone who actually knows ERI-223—not simply because none of her close confederates had any firsthand knowledge or belief that she knew of her pre-Guardian origins, but also because she is still active in the field and has personally denied sending these messages. That being said, in accordance with our rigor for skeptical inquiry, this agent was dispatched in pursuit of hard evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. I submit to you now photographic and video evidence recovered from civilian family albums, historical archives, and extant Ghost recordings originally captured in the Last City. Behold, ERI-223: a child of the Last City, born to civilian parents in a mortal-Guardian integrated neighborhood. Behold, too, tiny VIP #1786—though he is almost more unbelievable than ERI-223, if you look at his smile.\n\nOf the photos, original digital files are unavailable, but radiocarbon dating clearly identifies the earliest prints as more than three hundred years old. This is consistent with the timestamps of footage provided by volunteer Ghosts who were present during the same period. As to whether the child we believe to be ERI-223 is indeed ERI-223, please see the second compressed folder attached to this report for full double-blind forensics.\n\n4. In regards to the other personality presented in the six messages: Having consulted with AI-COM/RSPN and AI-COM/XBLK, both have attested that they have no record of any so-called craftmind designated Medusa. This does not discount the possibility that such a craftmind may have existed, but in light of the fact that someone was impersonating our former colleague, it follows that someone may have credibly invented a craftmind as well. We will continue to scour our records for any evidence to the contrary.\n\n5. Like many of those reading, this agent has a strong recommendation about the identity of the sender, but it is beyond the scope of this report. Cf. reports #024-VESTA-DC, 025-VESTA-DC, #026-VESTA-DC, #086-VESTA-DC, #001-034-HIVE-SAV, and #001-005-HIVE-DUL.\n\n6. Given the importance of #2014's contributions to our defense efforts as well as the recent downfall of the Awoken prince, this agent is deeply troubled by the idea that a malicious entity might seek to sway or confuse #2014 through the context of trusted allies. #2014's Ghost made brief mention of some kind of waking hallucination in one of its messages. Have we reached out to corroborate that report or provide additional counsel?\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

Live-fire training exercises continue at the active incursion site on the Leviathan. No further RAID class operations have been documented since the unauthorized intervention against VIP #4044 at the explicit invitation of VIP #3801. This agent still believes that the Vanguard should institute stronger measures to prevent rogue teams from carelessly rushing to the aid of enemy VIPs – particularly given #3801's documented history of solicitous behavior and the tendency of our warriors to rush slack-jawed toward free gifts. #4044 could have been a useful catspaw in the destruction of #3801. We should not have intervened.\n\n2. Related to the above, #3801's aggressive propaganda campaign appears to have been successful. Despite #3801's recent inactivity, sentiment polls captured in the Tower at regular intervals over the last several months indicate that he has successfully swayed a significant percentage of the Red War cohort to believe that he may be a potential ally. Given our history with the Cabal as well as the events of the Red War itself, this is shocking and perhaps attributable to a case of mass traumatic bonding.\n\nIt is my strong recommendation that the Vanguard pursue a reeducation curriculum before #3801 invites any Guardians of the City to defect to his service, a possibility which we have documented in multiple previous reports.\n\n3. Nessus continues to remain stable, likely due to Vex machinoforming.\n\n4. The Awoken armada continues regular shows of force. The Leviathan remains non-hostile.\n\n5. Our agents continue to closely monitor inbound and outbound traffic to and from the Leviathan. As yet, we have not been able to observe any non-Guardian transport, providing additional evidence for the fact that the ship is either a self-contained ecosystem which has no paracausal exits or that it possesses some kind of internal stargate network by which occupants may invisibly enter and exit. As the Cabal have no documented history of such stargates, we are inclined to believe the former.\n\n6. In summary, there is no real news. However, this agent is inclined to regard this conspicuous passivity with suspicion rather than relief, and would urge Vanguard leadership to consider exploratory excursions in coming months.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

Last week, I was deployed by IKO-006 for routine surveillance of the quarantined zone outside the Hellmouth. Hive populations remain low and grow ever lower thanks to the efforts of a small contingent of veteran Guardians who have made their homes on Luna.\n\n2. Around 1900 hours yesterday afternoon, I began to experience a crushing headache and excused myself from patrol to recuperate. Though I originally intended to lay down for a nap, I fell asleep instead, and experienced multiple vivid dreams over the next 11.5 hours. In all of these dreams, I was trying to catch up with agent ERI-223 in a crowd. She was always out of reach, whether by 200 m or 20 m. I had the sense that I needed to speak to her.\n\n3. When I woke, I found that my headache had not improved. I prepared my armor and exited my bivouac to find a single stationary Thrall crouched nearby. It stood as I approached, but made no motion to attack me. I fired one shot, killing it immediately. Upon stepping forward to examine its corpse, I saw a solid black fragment of an unknown material embedded in its chest cavity. The fragment resembled a flake or a shard of some larger object, not dissimilar to a high-gain photovoltaic panel.\n\n4. I requested that my Ghost perform a standard material analysis of the fragment but neither one of us could confidently identify its qualities or provenance; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #1.\n\n5. I requested that my Ghost attempt to contain and transmat the fragment for quarantine on my jumpship. He was unable to establish a Light link with the object, describing the fragment as \"slippery\" and \"tiring\" to try to catch hold of.\n\n6. I used the barrel of my sniper rifle to touch and then work the fragment out of the Thrall's corpse. Using my rifle, I turned the fragment over and examined it from multiple angles. I requested that my Ghost run another deep scan of the object; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #2.\n\n7. We concluded that the material seemed to be inert and that it did not seem to be part of any complex device or mechanism.\n\n8. At this point, I broke protocol and did not request additional backup. Instead, I picked up the fragment by hand and immediately experienced a vivid hallucination: I stood over VIP #0704's  shoulder as she dressed a seven-inch gash on agent ERI-223's thigh. Both #0704 and ERI-223 were dressed for combat. Hundreds of fragments of the unknown material hung in the air around us, apparent shrapnel from the wreckage of a nearby ship of unrecognizable make and model. ERI-223 looked directly toward me and said, \"Патетическая.\"\n\n9. The duration of the hallucination was approximately seven seconds. At its conclusion, my headache disappeared. My Ghost and I held our position for the next thirty minutes, then collected the body of the Thrall and the fragment for transportation. I delivered myself and my cargo to quarantine and experienced no further mental disturbances while detained.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

It is my belief that his presence will do more good than ill, and that the Tower has long stunted its own growth through narrow-minded fear and reactive exile of dissidents.

THIS DATA OBTAINED FROM SURVEILLANCE DEVICES AT 1315-HOME2.\n\n2. In previous reports, I stated that it was my belief that #1315 had invoked some kind of paracausal event enabling the resurrection and return of enemy VIP #2015. This belief was predicated upon reports of creatures resembling the infamous \"Echoes of Oryx\" that Guardian forces engaged and destroyed en masse during the Taken War (cf. Ghost-stream footage here: CATHEDRAL.OF.DUSK.DREADNAUGHT).\n\nThis has proven false. Spectral analysis from multiple Ghosts participating undercover in Prime and Reckoning confirms that the impossible world at the heart of \"the haul\" is located in unknown space. (Cf. REP #001-012-PARAC-NINE.) Further, these Primevals differ in their literal elemental composition: low SNC, high ambient ΛCDM. #1315 has harnessed his \"banks\" to what appears to be an engine of pure potential. He no longer needs to pilfer the Ascendant Plane of Primevals, the oldest Taken in residence. He can create Primeval-likes from the energy of \"the haul\" and sheer force of will. As to the apparent presence of #2015, it is a falsehood. My handlers in the Praxic Order surmise simply: the shape of Oryx was the scariest Hive he could think of. He's tenacious, but he has a small mind.\n\n3. Highly recommend we assess #1315 for the influence of paracausal forces or entities. Since the conclusion of the joint Vanguard/Praxic investigation into his operations, the subject has become increasingly erratic. Beyond running his Gambit and Reckoning drills with the Guardian population, he has done nothing but hole up in the Annex. He has always exhibited the signs of stress related to prolonged solitude that are typical of all surviving Risen; this manifests in the subject in prolonged and rambling conversations with either himself or his as-yet-unseen Ghost. However, his musings have become less and less coherent over time. Late into the night, away from the Guardian cohorts, he yells at voices that our surveillance equipment has never picked up. He has spoken to himself about trips across vast, interstellar distances to realms no Guardian has ever described.\n\nAgain, he has not left the Annex in ages. One might say that I am overstepping even Praxic boundaries here, but I would say to them: the subject is free to leave any time.\n\n4. Following the results of my investigation, the subject has ceased regular reports to Lord Shaxx. I'm sure both prefer it that way. #1315 has broken none of the Vanguard's decrees in that time, nor have any further Guardians perished on his watch in Gambit or Reckoning. He is still a facilitator to murder and a thief, but he has done nothing to warrant eviction, as I had hoped. The Vanguard obviously still needs him.\n\n5. The following is a transcript of one of his late-night rambling sessions logged for evidence:\n\nTYPE: PRAXIC SURVEILLANCE REPORT\nPARTIES: One [1]. One[1] Guardian-type, Class N/A [u.1]\nASSOCIATIONS: Gambit, Drifter, Annex\n[u.1:01] What now? What the hell is it you're trying to tell me?\n[the hum of a generator]\n[u.1:02] You showed me a universe with no Light. Dominated by the Dark. What are you arguing? Steadfastness in the Traveler's dogma? Ha ha. That's not obtuse enough for y'all.\n[u.1:03] No, no. I don't think so. Because then you showed me a reality without shadows, of pure Light from every angle. Nowhere to hide. Everyone begging to die, like we did in the Dark Age. Light's no gift, but I already knew that. What else you got?\n[a metallic clink echoes]\n[u.1:04] Yeah. I know the coin doesn't lie. It's the only thing in this world I trust for real. But you know what? I control the coin. And I make my own fate. No one writes on this but me, you got that? You pencil-necked, phantom-assed geeks. Have some respect for people's stuff.\n[a second metallic clink]\n[u.1:05] I've refused the Traveler's dogma for generations. And I'll reject yours.\n[a rush of static as the feed distorts from Light-based radiation]\n[u.1:06] You can't boil my brain, brothers and sisters–I see you tryin'. But I'm already there.\n[a fizzling crackle as the feed distorts from Light-based radiation]\n[u.1:07] And if you think you have a handle on Orin? Well, you didn't know her like I did. You slip up just once? That girl will eat you alive. Nine steak sounds mighty tasty if you can find it, scrape it all together. Get a fire goin' that'll cook it. What a fire that would be. You wanted to see what made us tick? Maybe Drifter wants to see what makes you stop.\n[a dull roar as the feed distorts from Light-based radiation]\n[u.1:08] Yeah, boy. That's a threat.\n[u.1:09] Hello?\n[u.1:10] No, not you. I still need you. This week. Get back to work.\n[u.1:11] What? Nothing...\n[u.1:12] Still hungry...\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

A marvel for one so young.\n\nBut, in true Guardian fashion, nothing you did for the City came from generosity.\n\nI think you want what everyone with power wants: more.\n\nThe man called Drifter knows this. That man has done what past influencers could not: manipulate Guardians into dabbling with the dark.\n\nAnd yet the Vanguard stands by in silence.\n\nCommander Zavala and Ikora Rey know who he is and everything he stands for.\n\nThey still let him bring his Gambit into the system. What's more, they have forbidden the Praxic Order from interfering.\n\nIt's against everything the Praxics stand for. We won't abide it, and we're looking into his activities, building a case against him even the Vanguard can't ignore.\n\nDo me a favor.

AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.\n\nSince its inception, the Vanguard has served as the City's greatest deterrent against total annihilation of humankind. And for an Age, it succeeded without question.\n\nBut today's Vanguard has never faced a threat like the Drifter. This man with no name and no verified history in the City's files has brought an ideological war to our doorstep. He's a greater threat than any Hive god or Vex Mind because I can't walk down to the Annex with a shotgun and end him.\n\nThe Vanguard won't allow it. They see a rogue element they can control.\n\nI see a criminal in a place of power.\n\nThe Praxic Order has been surveilling Vanguard activities: Guardians like you are abandoning frontline duties so they can run rampant in the Drifter's Gambit.\n\nEvery Mote of Dark they drop in his hands means another moment that the paracausal phenomenon in the Dreaming City is left unchecked. That our enemies in Deadzones across the Earth push our borders. In the absence of Light, even the Hellmouth on the Moon is stirring.\n\nThis cannot last. Ontological and genocidal threats aside, Gambit encourages the use of Darkness to fight Darkness... and other Guardians.\n\nSince the City's foundation, the Praxic Order has existed to keep Darkness and other banned assets out of the hands of City Guardians. Despite our best efforts, pieces like the Red Death, Crimson... and certain Weapons of Sorrow... continue to find their way into City arsenals. But even Guardian killers like those are nothing compared to the ideological threat of Gambit. Gambit leads to Darkness.\n\nAnd Darkness is the Hive on the Moon, tearing our kind to pieces in the Great Disaster. The Darkness is the Red War, the tower-fall—when the Cabal silenced the Traveler and killed thousands of the last humans on Earth in a single day. The Darkness is the Vex erasing our allies from existence, from memory itself. The Darkness is one man, with the power to deal final death in his fist. The Darkness was the Collapse of the Golden Age.\n\nThe Darkness is peace by annihilation in myriad ways.\n\nAs a sword of the Praxic Order, it is my duty to seek out those who would consort with or study the Darkness as a religious or paracausal entity. Participating in Gambit is problematic, but Guardians will go to where the guns are. If the Order wants to win this, the Drifter must fall. If I can get solid evidence that bastard is causing demonstrable harm, the Praxic Order will descend on him like a second sun.\n\nI know the Drifter has your ear, but consider this:\n\nThere's more to being a Guardian of the City than power."

        "text": "CORMORANT-LEVEL ENCRYPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS. AUDIO UNAVAILABLE.\n\n[The transcript has been bundled alongside the shattered remains of a Ghost.]\n\nThis Ghost belonged to a renegade Guardian, recently deceased in a shootout with Praxic elements in the City.\n\nHis Guardian, an equally dead Titan, went by another title:\n\nDredgen.\n\nThis pair were ideological followers of Dredgen Yor.\n\nNo reason for veterans of the Red War to brush up on late Dark Age history, so in case you haven't heard: Yor was among the first of our kind to kill another with the heretical use of Darkness. Even a Guardian can't come back from that.\n\nAll those who used his name in recent history belonged to an outlaw group called the Shadows of Yor. No two of them can agree on Yor's true ideology, but all strive to consort with the Darkness for power. According to the testimony of his former fireteams, Drifter was one of them. And might still be.\n\nThe group hasn't made an appearance in a long time. There are rumors of new \"Dredgens\" taking up the mantle at the behest of the Drifter. All relatively young Guardians: the Old Russian cohort or the Red War. Not the old blood of the original group.\n\nYou might be one of them. Or soon could be.\n\nJust know that I've confirmed some, perhaps all, of the old blood are back in town. The Ghost you hold in your hand belonged to one of them.\n\nAnd I would not be surprised if the renegade who hunts the Shadows, the Hunter who forged the Golden Gun itself, was close behind.\n\nI don't know why the Shadows have returned, but there are possibilities:\n\nTo Drifter's chagrin I'm sure, it's no secret City Guardians are playing with Darkness in the form of Gambit. Maybe the Shadows want to actively recruit. They've tried and failed in the past to put the use of Darkness into Guardian arsenals.\n\nBut the Drifter and the Shadows could be at odds. The man is a loner and a cheat, building as many bridges as he burns in the Guardian community. He has true allegiance to nothing and no one but himself. It's possible he's gathering Gambit regulars to defend himself from his own kind.\n\nOr the Dredgens are here to help their ally, the Drifter, with the operation of Gambit or some new, unknown goal.\n\nI share all this with you hoping for your confidence. The Drifter is not to be trusted. Involve yourself with him and the Dredgens at your own risk. Even if you carry their name, it's not too late to make the right choice.\n\nDon't end up like the Ghost in your hand. He did not die well."

And he's luring all of you from the Tower as test rats.\n\nUntil today, the heads of my Order believed the Drifter was attempting to craft a throne world, much like the Scorned Baron Hiraks did. Off the death of the Hunter Vanguard.\n\nIt surprised me, but we've found no evidence in or around the City that the Drifter's ever actually killed anyone (though there could be a mass grave aboard that destitute thing he calls a ship).\n\nYour excursion today corroborated the stories of multiple Guardians still loyal to the Vanguard: the Drifter's haul originates from the clandestine power known only as the Nine.\n\nThe Warlock orders have only trivial information on these beings, but it would seem the Drifter has been networking beyond forces of Light and Dark. Before him, the Awoken Queen was their only known associate.\n\nAs of this moment, I hope I can trust you to keep your eyes open and your reports honest. As one of Drifter's Gambit Prime candidates, you are among the first Guardians to see what that bastard is doing.\n\nYou're the Vanguard's eyes and ears in this. I hope you do right by them."

The Man must be busy.\n\nIt seems the fate of this town rests on your shoulders once again. The choices you make in the coming weeks could affect more lives than any bullet you've ever fired. Consider that.\n\nAnd consider this:\n\nThe Drifter is polluting minds, driving Guardians away from what he nebulously calls the \"Traveler's dogma.\" He's turned a lot of minds onto the idea that Darkness is a tool worth using.\n\nThis City was built on a foundation of fighting the Darkness and everything it stands for: the erasure of order, individual empowerment over the common good. The Hive and the Taken live to serve their gods. The Traveler empowers humanity to live.\n\nHe says otherwise, but the Drifter is not above systems. That armor he's offering you in his so-called \"Reckoning\" represents a choice in a system of his making. He's just here to disrupt the natural order for personal gain, and he doesn't care who dies for it.\n\nThe Vanguard is relying on you more than ever. Against the Drifter.

If he's writing down his \"lessons,\" maybe he'll write down the one scrap of truth that we need to nail him to the wall. Chase the rest of those \"tapes.\"\n\nIn the meantime, I followed up with my colleagues about the Nine. Used to be that every couple years or so, somebody would get to talking to Xûr, then they'd decide that they were going to be the great mind to crack the mystery of the Nine. Go off to find them. Bunch of Cryptarchs, mostly. A couple Guardians. Then the Light went out during the Red War, and one last ambitious mind went out in search of providence: a Sunbreaker by the name of Orin.\n\nShe came back as the Emissary. Set up the Trials, said the Nine were standing ready to judge the worthiest among us—for what, we don't know. Seems they like strong warriors. The disappearances have stopped since then. I should note here that a couple people called those disappearances \"abductions.\"\n\nWord of advice? Try to keep emotional language out of your reports.\n\nTo the knowledge of the Praxic Order, the Nine aren't allies of the Darkness. We've got solid intel from Reef spies that the Awoken Queen's working with them now beyond the system. Could be that they're up to no good, but—whatever's out there is apparently more important than all that suffering in the Dreaming City, and every Corsair I've talked to believes that through and through. I believe their belief. The Awoken have too much self-respect to live under a bad leader. Bad's different than popular, of course.\n\nAnyway, I don't think the Nine or their Emissary intend to harm you—not right now, at least. It'd be helpful if we knew what they wanted with Drifter, but... That investigation is up to you.

Before he could speak, his skull erupted in a bloom of Arc Light. A Void arrow lanced through the air and lodged in the throat of the second hostage. He slumped over, falling against his dead companion.\n\nThe man turned to look in the direction of the shots. The Golden Gun blazed bright in his fist.\n\nThe Ghosts of the dead Guardians materialized to resurrect their fallen charges—but were cut short as two restraining bands whistled through the trees and snapped across their frames.\n\nThe Ghosts fell, enervated by Arc pulses flowing from their restraints.\n\nLoose pebbles murmured down the cliffside as six Warlocks dressed in black dusters entered the camp single-file. They all carried Quitclaim shotguns.\n\nThe man did not move.\n\nThe woman leading the Warlocks stepped closer to the man. She held out a Cormorant Seal, fearless in the light of his ever-burning Gun. \"Aunor.

Aunor racked the Quitclaim. Her Warlocks followed her lead.\n\nThe man stood. \"Shaxx wouldn't like it if you all came home in pieces. Take them. I'll be watching. They so much as breathe wrong and they're mine.\"\n\nHe walked into the forest, fist still aflame. The campsite fell to darkness as he disappeared.\n\n\"Secure the Ghosts,\" Aunor ordered her team, holstering her weapon to begin a thorough sweep of the site."

No fireteam. No backup.\n\nShe had been chasing a lead on a group of new-blood Dredgens, taking her Sparrow over Veridian Bridge to a local Gensym lab. But the Shadows were waiting for her.\n\nFrom a hidden vantage point on an overpass above, a single rocket from a shoulder-mounted launcher had obliterated the road in front of her. She'd been thrown straight off her machine.\n\nIn that split second, she saw Bahaghari had tried to catch her in a beam of Light, but with a telltale whistle and snap, a restraining band had silenced her Ghost. She was falling by then.\n\nShe leaned into the roaring wind, transitioned her fall into a dive. The impact and temperature of the water shocked and chilled her to the bone as debris rained into the lake around her.\n\nShe started the long swim toward shore, toward a road she knew would take her to the overpass.\n\n**\n\nShe pulled up onto the overpass on a hijacked Pike and looked down at the smoldering wreckage of the bridge where she had fallen an hour ago. Bahaghari was nowhere in sight, but her helmet's visor picked up an echo of Void discharge from a sniper's vantage. It was consistent with the launch pattern of a shoulder-mounted Countess SA/2.\n\nShe patched it back to Drifter, and in return, he gave her the coordinates of three possible Shadow safehouses in the area. Without Bahaghari, she had to input them manually to her tracker HUD.\n\nShe selected the farthest one from her position and gunned the Pike.\n\n**\n\nBy the time she pulled up to an abandoned warehouse in District 125, the Shadows had already ransomed her Ghost on several City bands. They wanted clearance to take their jumpships out of the system by midnight. Without clearance, they'd kill Bahaghari.\n\nThe Vanguard ignored the missive entirely. Renegades were not to be negotiated with. Not even Osiris himself. And these Shadows were no Osiris.\n\nThe maglev train coming from Core East roared on a rail above. The next train would arrive at midnight.\n\nShe could see a light on the top floor of the rust-red building, and the silhouettes of several people.\n\n\"I'm not on that floor,\" Bahaghari said. Aunor started.\n\n\"How—\"\n\n\"I hacked the restraint. It's Praxic tech. We've got a renegade in the Order.\"\n\n\"Worry about that later. You said you're not on the top floor?\"\n\n\"No. The basement. Under the street. Building's empty except for us. Don't even think about a breach, you'll need a team. Or a Gjallarhorn.\"\n\n\"Don't have either, Bighari.\"\n\n\"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"You never call me that unless you're about to do something stupid.\"\n\n**\n\nShe had never driven a maglev train before. She liked the feel of power in the front car, watching the world hurtle past.\n\nThe train was empty. She had ordered all the passengers and the conductor off before she'd requisitioned it. You could convince people to do almost anything with a Cormorant Seal.\n\nThe turn came rushing up, and she keyed a control on her wrist.\n\nA series of proximity mines on the rail and the barrier that supported it exploded, and the train hurtled forward through the smoke and fire—\n\nDown onto a rust-red warehouse building far below.\n\n**\n\nShe could see everything Bahaghari could see, even in death.\n\nFor those inside the building, it was like the world was ending.\n\nBut her Ghost was free, heading straight for the front car of the train that had impaled the upper floor of the warehouse. A pair of injured Shadows, the only survivors, were right behind her as she came up to Aunor's slumped body, her eye blazing with Light.\n\nAunor emerged from a radiant column and ducked under the bleeding Shadow's haymaker, slamming a blazing palm into his gut. She burned straight through him and rolled forward on the momentum, under a thundering shot from the second Shadow's hand cannon.\n\nShe transitioned the roll into a stiff sidekick from the ground, shattering the man's unarmored knee. She mounted him as he fell and bludgeoned him unconscious with a rain of burning elbows.\n\nBahaghari came up behind her. \"There are three more bodies... somewhere under this train. What now?\"\n\nAunor stood up, covered in blood and ash.\n\n\"We take their Ghosts. Alert the Vanguard. We have five renegades in custody.\"\n\nAunor found her duster in the train cab, tattered and badly burnt. She put it on, clasped her Cormorant Seal in place, and sat next to the bodies, waiting for her prisoners' Ghosts to materialize.\n\nHer radio clicked.\n\n\"No casualties. You did well,\" Ikora said.\n\n\"Are you speaking as the head of the Warlocks or the head of the Hidden?\" Aunor returned.\n\n\"As your friend. You slipped, but you saved it. Zavala and I appreciate your help in this. It's imperative—\"\n\n\"That Drifter and Gambit continue, yes.\"\n\n\"Aunor.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are we good? We're asking a lot of you.\"\n\n\"I don't ever want your job. And the City needs that rat man's connections and his means. If he can bring Orin back to us...\"\n\n\"Mm. Let's talk more in the morning.\"\n\nShe looked out the viewport at the burning train rail above, and the ruins of the warehouse around her.\n\nShe supposed this was her life now."

As he walked, he wrapped the cloth around himself, covering his head and hiding his face. He changed his gait and his posture by degrees as he walked: moving a little slower, hunching a little lower. When he emerged into the next atrium, it was as though he had aged by sixty years.\n\nSpotting a group of elders basking in the sun, he shuffled over to sit down as one of them.\n\n\"You new here?\" one of them rasped.\n\n\"Always feels like it,\" he replied in a reedy lilt.\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" the elder said, staring at a squad of passing Titans whose armor reflected the sky. \"They always stay the same,\" he gestured at them. \"Everything around them changes on their whims. For good or ill.\"\n\n\"You're not wrong.\" It wasn't what he had meant. Once traffic died down, he could head straight for the Annex. No Guardians to pester him about rules or payout changes to Gambit.\n\nHe hated going out there with the Lights. Their earnestness pissed him off. He only did it 'cuz he had to eat. What he loved about Gambit was one thing, and one thing only: delectable Motes of Dark.\n\nThe bench creaked as someone sat down beside him. He didn't bother to look up. They'd go away eventually.\n\n\"Turns out your info was solid,\" a voice said. \"To my surprise.\"\n\nHe turned to look, and saw a woman: brown-skinned, crooked-nosed, with intelligent eyes and a hard stare. She wore a black duster, and light armor underneath. A Warlock. He didn't know her. \"You've mistaken me, my dear,\" he quavered.\n\nShe handed him an intricately designed slate about the size of a Titan's fist. A Cormorant Seal.\n\n\"The info you sold us on the Shadows was solid,\" she repeated. \"Are you switching sides?\"\n\nHe blinked. No use pretending. He dropped the act, sitting straighter. \"I'm on no side but my own. Are they alive?\"\n\nThe elders to his right frowned and began talking lowly amongst themselves.\n\n\"All but one. We couldn't get there before our mutual friend started his work.\"\n\n \"Those three were idiots. Chasing legends. No danger to anyone but themselves.\"\n\n\"I don't think you have a good gauge for that. But they're in custody now.\"\n\n\"If you're done, I'd like to spend more quality time with my blanket and these crusty fellows.\"\n\n\"We listened to your protégé's tapes,\" she said.\n\n\"You bastards,\" he said, with no fire in it.\n\n\"The Vanguard think they can use you,\" she said.\n\n\"And what do you think?\"\n\n\"You're a criminal not to be trusted. But... Orin gave you a chance.\"\n\nHe turned to look at her.\n\n\"And I think you think you can bring her back,\" she continued. He said nothing, but he didn't look away, either.\n\nAunor stood up. \"As you were.\""

The sky burning green, the roar of thunder ripping through the darkness, and the Eater of Hope tearing through our ranks. Crota, the merciless Hive prince whose dark campaign to pursue the Traveler led to the slaughter of countless worlds—all in the name of his father, Oryx, the Taken King.\n\nI'll never forget the Vanguard's failed attempt to reclaim the Moon from the Hive. The Great Disaster. We lost thousands, needlessly. I fear we are on the verge of doing so once again.\n\nNow the Hive are spreading across the Moon, perhaps mounting a defensive or some other insidious machination. We must access the inside of the Pyramid by whatever means necessary, to find what I believe may be the key to our battle with the Darkness. It's too critical to allow the Hive to interfere.\n\nThis is our duty. My fate has guided me here. We will set it right. The price will be high, but the alternative is not an option. It will take the collective might of all Guardians working together to lead us to a brighter future."

        "text": "Ikora,\n\nThe Nightmares appear to be extracted from our very psyche—violent manifestations that wreak havoc, tormenting us with our past trauma. They tease us with a life we once knew, prying into our minds and attacking our most vulnerable points. This assault on our emotions is aimed to weaken us and our sense of purpose. But I will not waver. Emotions can be overcome. I don't fully comprehend the power these Nightmares wield, or if they can truly be conquered, but I have yet to meet an enemy who could not be.\n\nI cannot shake the feeling that we are being toyed with, that these Nightmares are a hindrance to our goal. We must not lose sight of what they are guarding.\n\nPerhaps they wish to make us question ourselves and our will to fight, to overcome. Now, I lived in the darkness for years, barely escaping with what was left of my life. The toll it took on me to refortify myself is something I refuse to experience again. If the Pyramid is indeed testing us, it will find we are more than up to the challenge.\n\nThe Pyramid has also spawned another entity, one that presents a different kind of danger. It does not attempt to harm me physically. Instead, it seeks to wage psychological warfare—a battlefield I have lived on. The Pyramid had the gall to bring Sai Mota before me, devoid of her corporeal form, hoping to shake my resolve.\n\nI will admit, seeing this phantom was jarring, but the Pyramid underestimates my will. It was almost comforting to see her again. Nothing will break my determination. I can't allow it. Not with what's at stake.\n\nShould we falter, all our work—along with our goal of an existence without strife, pain, or hardship—will cease to be. No one should have to endure what I've lived through. As long as I am around, no one ever will… We cannot acquiesce.\n\nWe will show them the meaning of Light."

Their screams of agony haunted me for so long, but never did I anticipate hearing their voices again. The Darkness is deceptive and seeks to corrupt from within. It knows just where to strike.\n\nTerrible pain has resurfaced from a scar that I assumed had healed. Now something is scratching and clawing its way out. When we went after Crota to seek retribution for the Great Disaster, we knew there would be risks. We did not know it would be a suicide mission. I'm ashamed to say I never wanted to think about these events again. How can we move on from our past if we continue to live in it?\n\nThey were the last family I had before my time in the Dark.\n\nSix of us went in. Only I made it out.\n\nEriana-3, my leader—our first encounter consisted of an argument over a piece of music I loathed. Eriana was enamored with its melody and sought to convince me of its merits. Her unequivocal honesty in the face of dissenting opinions led me to pledge my total devotion and trust to her. I would hum the tune quietly to myself in the Dark, to stave off the madness that was consuming me.\n\nOur Titan, Vell, was the first to fall. I mourn him to this day and think of his courage in times of despair. We should all be so valiant in the face of overwhelming odds. Today, I will need his example more than ever.\n\nSai's knives were as sharp as her wit. She laughed in the very face of danger. Now, the same laugh that I heard countless times and that once brought me great comfort rings painfully in my memory and triggers nothing but anguish. How I wish I could amend that! She deserved more.\n\nPoor Omar was skeptical of our chances, yet his bravery endured—even as his Light was pulled from him by the Hive Wizard, the Heart of Crota. Few possess the fortitude required to press on when all hope seems lost. He has imbued me with the strength to weather the coming storm.\n\nAnd you know Toland, the Shattered—the mad Warlock who knew more than he let on. I had my doubts about him in the past, but time changes perspectives. I now respect his dedication to learning the ways of the Darkness and surviving despite them, much as I had to.\n\nBy confronting me with my lost fireteam and stirring up memories so painful, the Nightmares only confirm my earlier assumptions—I feel they are trying to distract us.\n\nRemain vigilant, no matter the cost."

She was ultimately defeated by a brave fireteam of Guardians, who drowned out her screams with a maelstrom of bullets and vengeance.\n\nNow her whetted shriek pierces my ears once again.\n\nThe Pyramid is playing its cards and going \"all in,\" as Cayde-6 would say. Oddly, I find myself thinking of him more now that he is gone. I suppose I've grown closer to other Guardians and the Vanguard than I realized. If the Pyramid is dragging the Nightmare of Omnigul into the fray, it tells me one thing: we are getting closer.\n\nI am aware that these Nightmares are not truly what they represent, but the mind can be fooled, even momentarily. In those moments lies all the destructive power the Darkness hopes to exploit. I fight back, but the Nightmares grow stronger.\n\nI worry how long I can bear the weight the Pyramid places upon me.

        "text": "My Queen,\n\nCrota's minions emerge once more. The Hidden Swarm that previously served Crota has banded together once again, leaderless but not purposeless. The energy emanating from the Pyramid has apparently attracted undesirable attention. If I am struggling to understand its potential, I wonder whether the Hidden Swarm has even scratched the surface.\n\nNonetheless, the Pyramid arrived on the Moon well before Guardians set foot here and remained unseen by us for eons. I spent years trapped in the Hellmouth, and all the while this force was buried beneath me, hidden by the Hive. If only I had known. How long has the Hidden Swarm been experimenting with the Pyramid's power? For all the Hive's efforts, they fortunately do not seem to have succeeded in penetrating the Pyramid's walls.\n\nNow that the Pyramid has activated, I sense a certain desperation in the Hidden Swarm. The Hive are frenzied. Their rituals and the appearance of Crota's daughter, Hashladûn, suggest that either the Hidden Swarm is seeking leadership, or it is so malleable that anyone desiring an army might claim them.\n\nWe cannot underestimate the Hidden Swarm. I know far too well what kind of damage these Hive are capable of. Too many victims have fallen to their bloodlust. I've… lost too much. Because of them, I lost my Ghost. I lost my eyes. They assumed me beaten. But they were wrong. I used their own dark magic against them, surviving and learning their tricks. I know where they are weak, a place only mentioned in whispers: the Catacombs. It is there that unknown shadows lurk, performing the most depraved rituals imaginable.\n\nShould some malignant force rise from the Darkness to guide them, I shudder to think what this brood could achieve. This must never be allowed to happen. The Hive may have suffered a momentary loss and could attempt retaliation, but now is our time to strike. No more distractions. We must get inside."

Is the Pyramid's power growing, or have we simply overlooked how far its reach extends? Neither answer would provide much comfort.\n\nThe plague of Nightmares continues to grow as the Pyramid exerts its influence. We may not be able to defeat the distractions, but Vanguard support in suppressing this mounting threat could be of great use. We can provide a distraction of our own while I focus my attention where it is most desperately needed: uncovering the secrets inside the Pyramid. I sense there could be a greater danger lurking in the darkness, and the Pyramid may just be our key to stopping it.\n\nEvery moment that goes by, we become more vulnerable, and our allies further endangered. I fear for my friends. This is the price we must pay, however. If we are to ensure a brighter future for us all, we will have to endure a darker present.

The Hidden Swarm kept this Ogre alive through foul rituals of rebirth, chained up in the Summoning Pits, its unnatural existence a reminder of the threat the Swarm poses.\n\nYet, seeing its visage has sparked an unexpected emotion within me: pity.\n\nI, too, know the pain of having to lead an existence you no longer want. The monster should have died and been forgotten. Instead, it had to live a life of indentured servitude. Sometimes, I feel the same. Though duty is my oath and privilege, I can't help but feel trapped by the endless cycle of the fight. Will it all be worth it in the end? Will I ever know peace?\n\nPerhaps the Nightmares are weighing on me more than I'd care to admit, as these thoughts flood my mind and cloud my judgment.

It is… a Nightmare, I believe, though it is hard to say with Taniks. He was assumed defeated by Guardians during the SIVA conflict, although he has come back from the dead so many times that I feel somewhat uncertain.\n\nAll I am sure of is that the Nightmares are growing stronger. They challenge my fortitude in a way I haven't experienced since my time in the Hellmouth.\n\nTaniks has changed in many respects over the years. He has enlisted the technology of the Fallen, Vex, and Humans to alter himself, out of necessity. He's a survivor, much like myself. Never in all my years did I think I would waver in my opinion of him, yet here I stand, sympathetic to a being who doesn't understand the meaning of the word.\n\nI sometimes question what kept me in the Hellmouth. Was I truly trapped there, or was I keeping myself there? Was it a self-imposed exile for the disastrous attempt at assassinating Crota? Was I a prisoner of my own making, doing penance for my mistakes? No. This can't be right.\n\nTaniks is a lawless murderer, with no moral code or ethics. There was that period, I am sure you recall, where it was assumed Cayde-6 had slain him, yet he returned—only to bring down Andal Brask in cold blood. Despicable.\n\nThis is not me; I'm no murderer.

We mourn them still to this day.\n\nSkolas's ambition was nothing if not relentless. In certain regards, I almost respect his sense of duty to his people. He was ruthless in his quest to lead his followers to glory. After his final revolt inside the Prison of Elders, Guardians banded together to thwart him once and for all—until today, when the Darkness summoned a Nightmare of him.\n\nI fear we may someday find ourselves in Skolas's place, shackled and bound, deprived of our friends and followers. Yet we cannot abandon hope… no matter how freeing it would be. To just give in to the Darkness. To give up. To feel no more pain.\n\nNo.\n\nSkolas was grueling to defeat. We must be the same.\n\nWe too shall adapt and become ruthless in hopes of staving off the Darkness. I feel the same sense of dedication to my people that Skolas felt for his.

Many of us are still rebuilding after the atrocities committed by this murderous fiend. He orchestrated one of the greatest tragedies our people have endured when he tried to steal the Traveler for himself and harness its Light, destroying our homes and the Tower, massacring thousands of innocents in the process.\n\nGhaul's most odious transgression was not his attempted theft of the Traveler, nor his part in the Speaker's death, but his profane, self-aggrandized fantasy that he would be chosen to receive the Traveler's Light. It would amuse me to think this brute, who excelled only at betrayal and subterfuge, would ever be worthy of the Traveler's Light, had his misguided campaign not led to so much senseless bloodshed.\n\nLight stands for self-sacrifice and devotion. Light is the hope of a peaceful, harmonious world. Ghaul sought only power. He would never have been chosen for the Light.\n\nI often wonder whether I was chosen, or whether I made a choice in my journey through this life. Did fate make me, or did I make my own fate? I cannot say with great certainty, one way or the other. I can only assert that I choose what I feel to be right in any given moment and hope I made the right choice.\n\nI was relieved when Ghaul was defeated by the might of Guardians and destroyed by the Traveler's Light. It was reaffirming. I spare no pity for Ghaul, as he was a wretched creature who got what he deserved. His rage-fueled quest for power will not prove our greatest test, however. I dread that whatever comes creeping out of the darkness next will dwarf the devastation Ghaul brought forth. We must steel ourselves for what lies inside the Pyramid."

He strides through half-formed steel-rust walls and across flattened earth foundations pocked from small-arms fire. He passes dozens of citizens welding fortifications, making repairs, and disassembling thin battle-scorched hovels to repurpose the materials into permanent homes.\n\nLightbearers dot the landscape, heaving great loads of metal to the burgeoning walls, melting beams together with Solar Light, or scanning for distant threats all along the many watchtowers that border the City like lighthouses guiding the lost into safe harbor. Ghosts project diagrams and schematics to steer the hands of each worker. One man pulls a crude cup from a bucket. It drips clean water as he lifts it to his lips and drinks deeply while the bucket is ferried away on pulleys to quench another group elsewhere.\n\n\"I've never seen so many Ghosts before. Will we be staying long?\"\n\n\"The Traveler is here, Sagira. Where better to find the answers we seek?\"\n\nThe smell of tea and spice flow through the air, bouncing punctually to the senses over aging smoke and fumes. An aroma of peppered meats draws Osiris toward a central square full of scattered materials and low cinder-chunk walls propping up scrapyard rifles. An armored Exo shuffles between cooking grills inside a ring of rubble.\n\n\"It sounded… grander,\" Sagira muses, surveying the tent city remnants in the distance.\n\n\"Rumors always do. It's not quite the foothold oasis Felwinter spoke of, but it is a start.\"\n\n\"What could be grander?\" The Exo chef clatters half a dozen wooden plates of food onto a rough stone counter. \"This is hope, Guardian. Quiet days like these… soon there will be more.\"\n\n\"I'm no Guardian. Just meeting a friend.\" Osiris looks to a far Tower jutting above the encompassing construction. Solitary; in the shadow of an osseous-white orb.\n\n\"I will be your friend. Come. Sit. Eat. There is enough for you to join us.

In the dreams, I shape planets with my own hands.\n\nAt first, I believe I am mad.\n\nThe clinicians at BrayWell call it \"interplanetary relocation maladjustment psychosis\": a psychobabble catch-all for mental disturbances that they can't explain. Other people, searching for certainty, call it \"prophecy.\" But all I can offer is a loose, tangled connection that I painstakingly unravel when I dream.\n\n|| I am drawn to a bright and attentive star. I speak to it through movement, through feeling. It understands implicitly. ||\n\nNow, I stand before a crowd. Their murmuring is the bone-deep rumble of shifting tectonic plates.\n\nA screen behind me plays looping, blurry footage of the Traveler terraforming Venus. The images radiate with pale light. We've watched this footage many times.\n\n|| I glide through space as if through water, tugged in nine directions by nine impulses. ||\n\nIn front of the crowd, I sway a little, a copse of trees bending in a dream-wind. I can't help it. I'm dreaming more often than not.\n\n|| There is whispering from the deep-dark, alluring and terrifying—a reminder of things left behind, bittersweet and abhorrent. ||\n\nA crackle of static on the screen behind me brings me back to earth, resettling my feet firmly on the ground. These people have come here for my insights.\n\nI lean forward and speak to the crowd. Four tenets, aching with truth:\n \nThe Traveler is a force of benevolence. \n\nThe Traveler is a sentient being with free will, dreams, hopes, and fears.\n\nThe Traveler will save us.\n\nThe Traveler will leave us."

The first time I saw them, I thought they were surveillance drones, but up close, they were nothing like our old technology, not really. The way they move seems organic and natural. They spin their shells like they are ruffling feathers; their little forward-facing lights blink like eyes.\n\n\"We're called Ghosts,\" one of them said to me once, hovering at my shoulder as I tended a cook-fire.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, gentle, casual. They're all different, these Ghosts. Many of them are like children, curious and friendly. Some are world-weary from the moment they're born.\n\nThe Ghost spun his silver petals, considering. \"Because we're searching, I think.\"\n\nIt's a good enough answer for me. I'm searching, too.\n\nI let the little Ghosts follow me. We talk about what the Traveler was like before the Collapse. They like to hear it, and I like to remember. Deep in their core, they remember, too, I think. They remember a time when they were all one piece. Still, they like to ask what the Traveler told me, and I recount all the dreams I can still remember. I haven't dreamed since the Collapse, and this is almost—almost, almost—like dreaming again.\n\nToday, at twilight, one of the shy and quiet Ghosts who has been lingering at my side asks if I will follow her out into the valley. I should say no, but she sounds hopeful. And I am curious.\n\nWe travel for several hours. The land here is recovering—not just from the Collapse, but from the time before it. Resources for our settlement are scarce, but nature is creeping back in, and nature is cruel now. It's been starving and confused for decades, jostled out of its natural order, and now we reap the consequences. Wolves steal our livestock. Mange-ridden bears wander through our compound late at night, pawing at our doors. The land is so thick with the memory of poison that it won't grow crops.\n\nWe protect ourselves from this recovering world as best we can, and we rarely go out at night. But I'm drawn by a curiosity that feels beyond me.\n\nThe Ghost leads me to a barn with a sagging roof. She asks me to wait out of sight—she says, \"I think you'll scare her.\" I don't fully understand what she means.\n\nI crouch and watch as she hovers over the years-old remains of a person, barely recognizable as something that was once living. The Ghost floats over the body nervously, and then scans it with pale light. In front of my eyes, flesh grows over old bones and tattered rags stitch themselves together. The person, a woman, gasps and sits up.\n\nI can't believe it.\n\nThe Ghost hovers close to her new companion and says something quiet and reassuring. I can't hear. I feel amazed, and then jealous, and then ashamed."

I look around for a Kell or a Priest—someone in charge—but we're alone. There are no Pikes or Ether tanks, no banners, no Servitors. I sit on a rock and look at my captors, more perplexed than afraid.\n\nThe shame of being captured by something so little and young-looking, when for so long we've managed to defend our settlement from their hulking Captains, is a little bit humbling.\n\nThe Dreg who grabbed me fidgets with a mask. One of his companions watches, while the other half-heartedly points an Arc spear at me. They seem uncertain. Nervous. Probably they weren't supposed to have done this.\n\nI wait patiently until the Dreg straps the mask to his face.\n\n\"You,\" he says in a crackling, distorted voice. I'm floored. They've managed to make a translator. \"You are the mouth of the Great Machine.\"\n\nThere have been negotiations with the Fallen since they arrived on Earth. Never successful, nearly always fatal, but they've happened. So I'm aware that some of the Risen know their alien language, and some of the high-level Fallen know ours. Dregs, though. It's another surprise.\n\nAnd… the \"mouth of the Great Machine\"…\n\nHm.\n\n\"I was,\" I say carefully. The Dreg narrows all four of his eyes as his tech translates my words. If he understands the distinction between \"I am\" and \"I was,\" he doesn't show it. Instead, he nods.\n\n\"You will tell us the Great Machine's words.\"\n\nIt doesn't actually sound like a command. I wonder if, with better translation tech, he would've said \"please.\"\n\nI don't say anything. If I reveal what I can't do, what I don't know, they'll probably kill me.\n\nThe other two Dregs gather around their companion, watching him eagerly. Now and then, they look at me. The one holding the spear has let her grip grow slack, and the spear is tipped down to point at the ground. The Fallen have surprisingly expressive faces. What I pick up from them is not aggression or hatred, but fearful anticipation.\n\nThe Dreg with the mask nods again, not discouraged by my silence. This time, when he speaks, I can hear his hope, even through the mask: \"Why did the Great Machine leave us?\"\n\nI stare back at him.\n\nAny fear I felt before dissipates. Instead, what I feel is a grief partially forgotten in the chaos of trying to survive—and a deep and abiding kinship with the enemies who have pursued us.\n\nMy voice is very quiet when I finally speak.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThe other two Dregs look at their friend, waiting. His expression twists with confusion, and then disappointment. There's anger there, too, but it's overpowered by something else. A very familiar sorrow.\n\nWe sit in silence for a long time."

In the days following the Collapse, any Speakers who survived were scattered to the wind, traveling with groups of refugees across the ruined wasteland that Earth became. Aside from the man who taught me, I've never met another Speaker in my life. For all I know, I'm the last one alive.\n\nBefore the Collapse, Speakers were chosen for their ability to hear the Traveler through detailed, lucid dreams. Since the dreams have stopped, there are other signs. Ghosts follow us. When we do dream, we see a strange and blinding white light. We are prone to headaches.\n\nMy mentor couldn't teach me how to interpret dreams, so he taught me in hypotheticals. I had to imagine what the dreams might be like. I had to speculate why the Traveler might come back to us and when. Like all Speakers, I memorized the four tenets: The Traveler is good. The Traveler is sentient. The Traveler will save us. The Traveler will leave us.\n\nSometimes I worry the Traveler has already left us.\n\nMy mentor died of a wasting sickness two years ago, and I've tried to live as his replacement. But where he was a living memory of when the Traveler was awake, I have only his memories, secondhand, imperfectly understood. I can't give answers. I can't make the Traveler speak.\n\nOr, at least, I couldn't.\n\nFor weeks, I have worked in secret on a project, gathering scrap metal and old, broken things left over from the time before. I've cobbled it together, tinkered with the mix of strange and half-understood technology, tried to calibrate it to my needs.\n\nA long time ago, long before the Collapse, astrophysicists recorded sounds from the planets in our solar system and turned them into music. They translated plasma waves and radio emissions into eerie, musical rumbles, roars, whistles, and hisses. The Traveler makes sounds, too. Speakers have listened to its music for many years, in the form of dreams.\n\nCarefully, lovingly, I build a mask. An amplifier.\n\nNo one knows about it but me. I won't get their hopes up, even though mine are sky high as I put the finishing touches on it. It's not beautiful like our old technology was. It is scuffed and bent and rusted, like everything we own now. But if I'm right, if I can do this, it will do beautiful things.\n\nI can't bear to fail. I have failed at everything else so far.\n\nWhen I'm finished, I wear the mask. Pieces of it, not sanded down, are rough and sharp against my face, but I dream for the first time in my life.\n\n|| I have cried out unheard for so long that my voice is raw. ||"

The elation of success. The pain of failure. The candle-snuff of death. The gasping of rebirth. You feel it all at once.\n\n---\n\nI am the last Speaker.\n\nI am the child of two self-exiles, and I live in a settlement in the shadow of a looming mountain. There are about three hundred of us, and we've lived here for nearly seven years. When we first arrived, we were under the jurisdiction of a Warlord named Cathal. He offered us protection for a high price, requisitioning a third of our supplies and conscripting nearly half our people to his cause. The actual protection he provided was limited. The Warlords used our valley like a battlefield, crashing through like giants who couldn't see the lives they were ending. But they could. They saw us. They just didn't care.\n\nThe Iron Lords drove Cathal out nearly a year ago, and we've lived in comfortable independence since then, with little oversight from our Risen saviors. Our people voted for that. The Iron Lords saved us, but they would be no different from the Warlords if they also wished to rule us.\n\nNow I sit in negotiations with one of them, a woman named Lady Efrideet.\n\n\"You're free to decide either way,\" she says. \"But if you say yes, you'll have an armed escort.\"\n\nThree other people sit with me: our elected mayor, our most experienced physician, and our oldest resident. We are the people our settlement chose as representation. Beside me, a silver Ghost spins his shell, floating at my shoulder, watching Efrideet. He's followed me for over a year now, and still hasn't found his chosen. He's good company.\n\n|| I have given so much of myself already, but I give more. I become a beacon. I call my children home. ||\n\n\"A consolidated population like that, all in one place,\" our mayor says. She sounds weary. She's been in her position for nearly sixty years. \"It would draw Warlords to us like flies.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the Warlords,\" Efrideet says, with the cool assurance of someone who only half-understands our worry to begin with. \"Their days are numbered. Their way of life is incompatible with the Iron Decree, and so…\" She shrugs.\n\nHer nonchalance is unrelatable, but I think I trust her. I trust the Iron Lords. They've given us little reason to doubt them.\n\n\"How would the city be governed?\" I ask.\n\nEfrideet shrugs again. \"That seems like the kind of thing you put to a vote.\" She taps her fingers on the table, impatient, but only a little. \"We'll just build the place and bring people there. We can defend the walls, but we're not going to dictate what happens inside them. This is a joint venture. A collaboration.\"\n\nMy companions exchange looks, considering.\n\nEfrideet watches us. Like most of the Risen, she tries to look impassive. Unaffected. But if you listen closely, she's trying to convince us. She wants this. \"Listen,\" she says. \"Risen and non-Risen have lived in their separate corners for too long. We're all people. That's all the Iron Lords are trying to say. We should live together.\" She pauses. \"There are things we can teach each other.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, once we've packed up everything we can carry, we leave for the place where we'll build the Last Safe City of Earth.\n\n|| I wish for something to grow in my shadow. ||"

It only understands a fraction of your words, but it tries, and that has to be enough.\n\nLife goes on beyond your control, as it always has. That is the curse of your creation. The things you build are not your own.\n\nAnd then another star blinks into existence.\n\n---\n\nI am the last Speaker, and I sit at a table with the Vanguard while the City around us fights over nothing.\n\n\"We built this City to find some kind of unity,\" Tallulah says. She has her hands on the table and is leaning forward, like she might jump over it. \"We're breaking apart from the inside.\"\n\nSilence falls over the room. I am trying to think.\n\n\"What does the Traveler say?\" Saint-14 asks, quietly. Everyone looks at me.\n\nI breathe in through my nose, breathe out slowly. \"About the factions?\" I ask. \"Or about people killing each other in our streets? This is not what the Traveler wanted. That much I can tell you.\"\n\n\"That was the direct result of creating us,\" Osiris says, leaning back in his seat. He is stone-faced, as always. \"Violence. Does the Traveler truly know what it wants?\"\n\nI try to hide my frustration, and I'm glad my face is hidden by my mask.\n\nThe truth is this: I cannot say for certain what the Traveler wants, or whether it knows what it wants. The Traveler does not speak to me in words, but in dreams. Dream language is cramped. The messages come from the Traveler, disintegrate on the way to me, and reform into something else. I am an interpreter more than a Speaker.\n\nBut uncertainty has been the death of us before, and it will be again if we are not vigilant.\n\nSo what I say is, \"The Traveler has always wanted to protect humanity, on its own or through Guardians. We need to enact that will.\"\n\n\"With all due respect to both of you,\" Tallulah says, eyeing Osiris and me. \"This isn't about the Traveler. This is about what happens when people come together without anyone to really lead them.\" She taps her foot. She's nervous. Unusual for Tallulah. \"Let this go on a little longer, and this is the same as the Dark Age. It's just Warlords, packed into a tighter pen.\"\n\n\"A body of representatives would help,\" Saint-14 says. \"Something to allow all sides to be heard.\"\n\n\"Every side has a voice, but not all voices should be given the same weight,\" I say, shaking my head. \"Some of these ideas are dangerous. We should determine which factions can continue to exist, and give them an official channel through which to air their grievances and pursue their needs.\"\n\n\"Which ideas are dangerous, Speaker?\" Osiris asks. He is watching me, steadily. \"And who decides that?\"\n\n\"This is not a fight,\" Saint-14 says. \"We have enough of those ahead of us.\"\n\n\"We will hear from each of the factions,\" I say, ignoring Osiris. Some decision is better than no decision. \"Give them the opportunity to plead their case, save for those who have resorted to outright violence.\"\n\n\"Well, then we've got to get rid of Echelon South, for one,\" Tallulah lists, counting on her fingers. \"And those Binary Star idiots, too. Trinary? Binary? Whatever. Anyway, there are plenty of fingers pointed at this new group, too. Monarchy something.\"\n\n\"If anyone can prove the rumors, we exile their leaders,\" I say, holding up my hand. \"The factions that stay will argue their case. Of those that have a valuable viewpoint to bring to the governance of the City, we create a council.\"\n\n\"This sets a dangerous precedent, Speaker,\" Osiris says. We will have this argument again later, I can already tell. \"I hope you're prepared to walk this slope.\"\n\nWe vote. Osiris is the only no. Then, after an inquiry into the violence, we form the Consensus."

Guardians have no fear of heights.

To see a Guardian stroll through the Tower, flocked by unpaired Ghosts. I've interviewed hundreds of people via long-distance comms. I've consulted the Traveler. I've walked daily among the crowds of civilians and Guardians at the entrance of the City.

Hundreds of years of pointing and shooting, Speaker…\" She shakes her head. \"I don't know what it is yet, but I want to find a different way.\"\n\nThis conversation feels so familiar. I was so young the last time we had it.\n\n\"I understand,\" I say, softer now. \"That's a noble cause.\"\n\nShe shrugs. \"And maybe I come back with a little baby Speaker.\"\n\nShe doesn't say it, but the \"if I come back at all\" hangs in the air between us.\n\n\"I would appreciate your help,\" I say finally. \"I can't wear this mask forever.\""

This is not what you deserve.\n\nThe fear is enough to make you want to leave.\n\n---\n\nI am the last Speaker, and I dream that the Traveler will leave us.\n\nIt shouldn't be a surprise. This truth has been passed down from Speaker to Speaker for generations: the Traveler is good, the Traveler is sentient, the Traveler will save us, and the Traveler will leave us. For many, many years, I believed that the prophecy of the Traveler's departure was misinterpreted, and fulfilled instead by its silence after the Collapse. I stopped preaching that final tenet. It only served to frighten people.\n\nMy dreams, which have always been infrequent and fleeting, come more regularly. They are more confusing than ever, more disruptive. I once so rarely dreamed while awake, but now it happens all the time.\n\n|| I am silent again. I am gone. I leave behind a yawning void. ||\n\nMy dreams forecast a terrible future: a future without the Traveler's Light.

But I know it is coming.\n\nThe details almost don't matter.\n\nI've lived my whole life bringing people into the Light of the Traveler. I've made promises and assurances all based on faith.

They ask how to cope with loss, and change, and fear—all daily realities of this life. They ask how to cope with doubt.\n\nI lie through my teeth and tell them to trust in the Traveler.\n\n|| Empty. Empty. Empty. ||\n\nThe dreams continue. The headaches get worse. But I believe so strongly that this knowledge would destroy our way of life, and I hold it so tightly that it poisons me.\n\nIt's all for nothing.\n\nI'm in my apartment when I hear the first ground-shaking explosion, and I go outside to see what's happened.\n\nI see the Red Legion fleet darkening our skies, and I realize I have made a terrible mistake."

He had expected the projectile to hit a Kinetic barrier, or best-case scenario, impact the Pyramid and cause utterly infinitesimal damage.\n\nInstead, at the moment of impact, the projectile stopped existing.\n\nAsher's brow furrowed while an irrepressible smile crept over his face. His metal arm clicked and hummed gently of its own accord. This Pyramid had the audacity to park in front of his laboratory and pull such a cheap trick?\n\nClearly, it had not thought it would meet Asher Mir.\n\nHe assembled another missile, one with a detectable radiation signature and a radio signal. He fired it at the Pyramid. It similarly disappeared on impact, its signals snuffed out, no longer detectable from Io's surface.\n\nAnother payload followed, this one a miniature relay station. He routed it through his console and fired. At the moment it touched the Pyramid, it transmitted a spike of radiation and radio broadcast.\n\nAsher smirked. They were still there, held in the field of the Pyramid. Visually undetectable, signals squelched, but still physically there.\n\nHow the Pyramid was accomplishing this feat was unimportant at the moment, though his mind flooded with fantasies of zero-point energy.

She bellowed at the men working on the deck to cover clear of the cargo as she drew her Scout Rifle and dropped to a knee.\n\nThe first few Dregs were dead before they hit the ground, but the winds whipping off the seas sent her next shots wide. She figured the landing party would go for the cargo shuttle over her men, so she spun to take a sightline toward the craft, but the things were charging for the supplies instead.\n\nShe cursed and leapt over the railing, landing like a crash of lightning. Her earpiece sprang to life. \"Siren's Watch, this is supply craft Vienna Stinger looking for a place to put down.\"\n\n\"Landing pad five, south side!\" she shouted over the crack of her rifle. \"Offload what you brought, and I'll have a supply team swing by in a minute.\"\n\nShe plugged two more Dregs and the Ketch's engines changed from a roar to a whine. A halfhearted volley of Wire Rifle fire spattered the landing pad from the Ketch as it blasted away.\n\nSloane called out to her team. No fatalities, nothing taken but two crates of fresh supplies. She ordered the team to the next landing pad and began climbing the long stairs back to her perch.\n\nThey hadn't hit while they were loading the Golden Age technology for shipment back to the City. They were after the supplies. They were leaving.\n\nShe looked up at the Pyramid in the sky and frowned.\n\nThe door to her office closed and sealed with a hiss. A soft blue light on the panel promised that the seal was airtight. Sloane walked across the room to watch the seas through the open hole blown in the side of her rig."

She could visualize the bleeding code running through her fingers. Zavala's voice was in her ear, as ambient haze—relegated to the background of her mind like distant gunfire. The image of the Pyramid's distortion wave was still raw. This wasn't an attack. It was a command. A lazy dismissal of all their best laid plans.\n\nThere were no explosions. No blaring sirens or sparks of dramatic electricity. Nothing to combat or fix. Just a Guardian walled in silent black glass and disbelief.\n\nShe had been so sure.\n\nAna's eyes tracked Jinju as the Ghost sped from console to console, attaching strings of Light to each. They slowed her as she went, buried under some load.\n\n\"Ana,\" Jinju's voice strained under crushing distortion. \"I think I've got him. Most of him, but not for long.\"\n\nThe words cut through the distant gunfire. \"What?\" Ana asked. Her voice came softly at first, unsure what form to take as the information processed. \"What?!\"\n\nJinju groaned and whispered an exasperated, \"Pillory… Engram…\"\n\n\"It's not ready.\"\n\n\"Ana, now!\"\n\n\"He'll go insane! I… can't.\"\n\nThe Light tethers attached to Jinju began to pop one by one. \"It's this or nothing!\"\n\nThe prospect sent Ana tearing across the room. She belted a command into the air, and a floor safe opened in response. Ana snatched the dodecahedron enclosure from the safe and braced it in front of Jinju.\n\n\"Jinju, do it!\"\n\nThe Ghost's shell reformed to forge a directing structure before her core erupted with Light and data. A stream of pure information beamed into the Engram, filling it with spiraling wisps of Light.\n\n\"Did you…?\"\n\n\"As much as I could.\"\n\nOutside the windows, bolts of atmospheric friction dragged flames through the sky as Warsats plummeted from low-orbit defensive positions.

He extended his hands. \"May I?\"\n\nThe Titan shrugged, then dug into his pack for the Shotgun.

It was heavy, loaded with seven—no, eight shells. Tactical mag. Getting this one had taken some time.\n\n\"And how many timelines did you thoughtlessly tether to our own for this weapon?

Four hundred fragments?\" He paused, aghast. \"More?\"\n\n\"It's got a trench barrel,\" said the Titan helpfully.\n\n\"Remove yourself from my sanctum,\" Vance said, placing the Shotgun down like a dead animal. \"You have accelerated the end of all things, and I must update my prophecies accordingly.\""

Well-read as he was, he didn't have the energy to arrange the required words.\n\nIt was late during what passed for night on Io, and while Asher was tired, he hiked on diligently. He stopped only once, briefly, to study a snail whose shell was growing tiny clusters of crystalline black obelisks.\n\nHe crept down through the cavernous spaces beneath the Cradle. Unfamiliar roots protruded from the earthen walls. He calmly observed the pattern of a twitching Shrieker, and his calculated ricochet sent a band of Taken roaring down the wrong pathway. He passed unmolested.\n\nEris was in her meager camp near the twisted roots of the enormous Tree. She knelt near a beam of light coming from far above, which filtered through the pith of the Tree to strike an unnatural splash of cambium petals. Asher noticed the smells of sap and burned cooking oil.\n\nShe said she was pleased to see him, though when she sought to clarify the cadence of his supply drops, he felt she might be put off by the unexpected visit.\n\nAs he unpacked what he had brought her, she explained the Tree, the messages, the whispers. The thrilling struggle to glimpse the face of the unknown, even if that unknown may be trying to kill you. She was smiling as she spoke. Asher understood exactly what she meant.\n\nHe rested by the fire. Nearby was a small table that held samples of Hive chitin, clippings from the Tree, ashy soil, and an open notebook that Asher saw was a personal journal, which he quickly flipped shut with distaste.\n\nHe reached again into his pack. He brought forth a bottle of fine golden spirits (from when some towering ignoramus misunderstood his request for isopropyl alcohol) and placed it on the table. He had brought two clean glasses, nestled ridiculously in the boxy shipping case of a large graduated cylinder. He removed one and placed it gently next to the bottle.\n\nAsher coughed, relaced his boots, then stood and shouldered his pack.\n\n\"You have things taken care of, yes?\" he said to Eris.\n\n\"Certainly,\" she said, intent on the beam of swirling light.\n\nHe shifted and made a little noise in his throat. \"I need to know that things will be taken care of,\" he said clearly.\n\nEris looked over and considered the man standing across from her. \"To the best of my ability,\" she finally said.\n\nAsher nodded and began his long walk back."

And if he worked in descending priority, he might never make it to his assistant, which would defeat the purpose of the exercise completely. Instead, he went to the Pyramidion.\n\nThe Vex are not born, yet not created. Desire to understand this conundrum brought Asher to Io. He reasoned that the Pyramid, with its alien resources and unknowable power, had likely come for the same purpose. The dark ship sought to take the secrets of the Vex for itself.\n\nBut Asher Mir had already staked his claim, and he was prepared to defend it.\n\nHe soon stood at the gate of the Pyramidion. The Vex security responded as he knew they would, and he was prepared. He piled their broken corpses on the plates and continued inside.\n\nHe destroyed the first hundred Vex, then the second. A Minotaur roared into being before him and he crushed its radiolarian core in his metal fist. He climbed forward over their clawing limbs. He slipped in the cooling roux of their dead fluid.\n\nAsher swallowed a mouthful of blood and kept moving.\n\nHe paused by a whirling gate and watched the aperiodic waves, then stepped through at the only possible moment. He walked steadily through laser grids that seemed to bend around him. He hung calmly in a gravitational tourbillon as the ground beneath him flickered and shifted madly.\n\nAnd the Vex began to observe.\n\nThe corridors of the Pyramidion were lined with glowing red eyes. The metal mannequins stood dumbly, twitching, shuddering as Asher passed.\n\nA familiar area unfolded before him: a cubist sinkhole reeking with the flat, base stench of slate mud and bleach.\n\nHe looked where the sky should be and found another impossible shape; another fractal contradiction. Far above him, placid in its Penrose vortex, the vast radiolarian lake lapped gently at the metallic shores.\n\nThe man reached up to the lake with his metal arm.

When I emerged, hardly anyone trusted me; rarely did others see value in me. Except you. You have always remained an ally, without my asking. \n\nI am now asking. The Darkness's arrival ushers in a new age and, with it, the revelation of Stasis. We must seize this opportunity before it is too late. This Collapse now escalates—our enemies' agendas advance, and we are losing. \n\nThe Vanguard has played its part in bringing us to this stage, but Zavala is stalwart and far too stringent in his ways. He will never permit us to wield the Darkness in service of the Light. I know this journey into Darkness is dangerous and unprecedented. You and I know few have tried, and even fewer have lived. We will become the exception. \n\nIt is an audacious claim, surely uttered by easily corrupted fools, but it is one I intend to see through. I know what they are saying. They fear what I will become. Help me to assuage those fears. I am in control.\n\nI have touched Darkness and have seen its plans for us. Do not trust it or its messages of peace and salvation. Stasis is not a gift; it is a tool. One that can be molded to fit our needs, and I have seen how to manipulate it for our gain. The surge of power can be overwhelming and tempting to give in to, but my will is strong and brighter than the darkest of nights. I have dug in, carved new paths, and found sinew reserves in myself long thought depleted. \n\nWe can win, Ikora. If we wield this tool correctly.

Nothing will dare stand against us when we command the Dark and Light. You believed in Osiris's teachings of balance once. Do not tell me you falter now. I know you are wavering. This is an opportunity to find meaning and purpose the Vanguard hasn't provided. The foundations you've helped lay will provide stability, but they must be built upon.\n\nI need you to help preserve the ideals we have been fighting for, now more than ever before.

While I use Darkness to combat it, my focus remains steady. I know there are threats far greater assailing us on all fronts. We must strike back in measure, and this is my part, my front.

Oryx would never have led the Taken without its guidance. Eramis's army has been a vile, deadly force due to its influence. We should learn from their examples. It will subjugate us all if we allow it, so we must spread our message of balance through the Dark. We must show our control—or we too will be lost in the shadow it casts. Now is the time to rise up and take command. Use its power to eliminate the puppets in its grasp.

Be their lodestar for hope.\n\nThat is our path to eradicating those who misuse the Darkness. Through our singular focus and unparalleled strength, our enemies will fall by our hand, and the unending night will give way to a dawn not seen since the Golden Age. \n\nIs that not what we are fighting for?"

        "text": "Drifter,\n\nWhile your presence is often irritating and your odor repellent, you have proved yourself quite knowledgeable regarding our foes. As Darkness appeared, you did not flinch. Your assistance during its arrival was greatly appreciated.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would belittle you and tell you how one such as yourself is unworthy of the position you find yourself in. But nothing is normal during these times, and I accept any ally willing to see past the antiquated philosophy we have sustained ourselves on for so long. You too acknowledge the need for balance during this time of extremes. Need I remind you our actions must reflect this. Your unpredictable nature has no place here. We must remain steady in our convictions, no matter what the Vanguard or the Guardians say. Keep your ears open. Should forces gather against us, it is paramount that we outmaneuver any counter to our plans.\n\nWe are both accustomed to working alone. For this effort to be successful, we must cast aside selfish intentions and find common ground. Alone, we will collapse under the weight of this undertaking, and the Darkness knows how to exploit weakness. I know you feel it as well—the power Stasis brings. Does it frighten you? Even though I believe my grasp stronger than yours, I do not have any illusions regarding the Darkness. It will tear through your lack of conviction faster than you can abandon the cause. \n\nI am curious, however, as to your feelings toward the Stranger. You appear as a creature of instincts, and mine remain sharp. I am nagged by the sensation that she is not being entirely forthcoming, and much of her information is shrouded in speculative riddles. I believe her intentions are true, but I cannot separate myself from the uncertainty I feel. Where does your confidence lie? I suspect you do not trust anyone, myself included. Perhaps that is a trait worth adopting. \n\nWe will be tested in ways we are not prepared for. I hope you see the gravity of our charge, despite your consistent mockery and cynicism. This is no time for humor, though you may not have the capacity to process your emotions without it. It is wise to keep your comments to yourself. Invest in a journal for reflection when times are lighter. \n\nAnd, lastly, I ask you to refrain from referring to me as \"Moondust.\" Perhaps then I can overcome citing you as \"Rat.\""

        "text": "Osiris,\n\nI fear this letter may never reach you, old friend. Your disappearance is as mysterious and unexplained as the loss of the planets we suffered. I write to you because we are in the midst of a new era. You predicted this turning point long before it was on the horizon, and we are in need of your wisdom, now more than ever before. \n\nYou will be pleased, or mortified, to know you were correct. Balance is the only true way. You have seen the scales tip firsthand; too much in either direction has never resulted in the harmony we hope to achieve. \n\nThe Vanguard is dubious of our intent and ability, fearing corruption and displacement. They do not trust me. You were held in similar contempt for speaking your truth and empowering free thought. You know what it feels like to be chastised and labeled a traitor. We are mere steps away from a disintegration of our institutions, and they cannot see destruction staring them in the face. \n\nWe have been manipulated from all sides. Savathûn has played the Darkness as an instrument of deceit, while the Vanguard has used the Light to blind us. There was power in between, kept from our grasp. No longer. Ikora wavers. She stares at the precipice, unwilling to fall into the abyss. We can no longer wait for her to make a choice. While it pains me greatly, this is not the time for personal feelings to factor into actions. I have allied with those branded unsavory and have taken the power the Darkness holds to oppose it. It cannot oppress that which it does not control. \n\nFor so long, we have clung to the Light, denying the strength offered by the Dark. By using Stasis, we will end this war. We see this contest for what it truly is: a game, played by our adversaries. And we have been the pawns. \n\nWe are pawns no more. \n\nThis is not a battle I want to wage without you, although we may not have a choice in the matter. Wherever you may be, please come back to us."

I am sorry I was not there for you at your final hours. What you must have felt, knowing you were facing the certain end… I hope the majesty of Io and the sacred land of the Cradle provided some comfort where I could not.\n\nYour affliction was ravaging you—this is known. After all your suffering, perhaps you welcomed death. In a way, I envy you. To know tranquility. To discover what awaits us on the other side of this fight, beyond the torment. That does not excuse my absence, for which I struggle to forgive myself. \n\nI will never forget how you cared for me after my escape from the Hellmouth. You provided me with hope after I had lost all, and compassion when I believed I deserved none. You made me feel myself again.\n\nI have stolen strength from the Darkness, imagining it would lead to a changed world after all of this. There would be peace. A cure for you. A warm cup of jasmine tea between old friends.\n\nIt was an end that justified the means.\n\nI make a solemn vow today to you, Asher: I will have our revenge. I am powerful beyond our enemy's anticipation. The abominable Hive will be exterminated, and Savathûn's illusions of sovereignty will be broken. The vile family line will end with the Witch Queen. I will not stop there. The Vex will have their day. I will scream your name, so it echoes for eternity as I banish them in time to rust and decay and be forgotten.\n\nOur enemies sought to corrupt us from the inside. They believed us compromised and invaded, but our infections will be healed through my actions. They were unaware that we were siphoning knowledge. We are the infections now, and we will rot them out.\n\nToo many of my friends have disappeared. Paranoia warns me more will follow. I must act quickly. Your legacy will not be forgotten, and your work will fuel the eventual Vex deletion. I will see a monument built in your honor. Rest assured, till our Light shines together again."

The Black Needle punctured our deficiencies, injecting fear and doubt into our cause.\n\nYou have grown greedy, Witch. Your ambition has forced you to overextend your reach. You have revealed your weaknesses and, through Stasis, I have become powerful enough to rid us of your curse on existence. We control the Darkness and the Light now, and it will be your undoing. Your hands are wet with the blood of my allies. I have not forgotten the suffering your meddling has caused. We saw you, the puppet master behind Oryx's plot. We heard your screams as Crota met his end. Your cowardice will conceal you no longer.\n\nI am coming for you. \n\nI will be your end. As your elders before you and your progeny after you fall, and all that surrounds you crumbles, Eris Morn will stand in front of you, smiling as I wipe your name from the Pantheon of Gods. You will suffer a humiliating defeat as your power dwindles and your influence withers. \n\nWe will laugh at your demise. You will become a fascination. Children will sing songs and tell cautionary tales of the old witch whose avarice deprived her of her desires. You will fade into fable and, eventually, nothing. A bygone dream of pains no more.\n\nDo you understand this clearly, Savathûn? \n\nWe are no longer forced to endure your torture. There is no veil for you to hide behind. We see you plainly. Your orchestration has led to too many foul notes. All your attempts to subjugate this power have failed.\n\nYou are a plague, and we are the cure. Your army will be eradicated, and the Hive will be a layer of dust, cushioning our footsteps. Trust me—you will hate it. \n\nI find myself giddy at these thoughts. Revenge suits me, it seems. I no longer know fear. I am overcome with certainty. When next we come face-to-face, I will remove the bandages that shield me, so I may see you for all you are and all you are not. And you will see me and know that the fire that burns behind my eyes will be your oblivion, suffocating and searing you to ash.\n\nPrepare yourself. I am your ruin."

I am certain the rumors that circulate in the Tower have found their way to you: Eris Morn has been compromised, corrupted by the Darkness. You and I know that could not be further from reality. You have stood by me, and we have been empowered, enlightened, and vivified. We have struck a balance.\n\nThere is much that you are already aware of. You have seen how the Darkness does not seek to subjugate, as the Light does not. They are tools. They are choices. They are made to be commanded and controlled. This is clear now.\n\nAlong the path, you have been the only consistent allies worth trusting. I have my doubts about the Stranger and, similarly, the Drifter. If they fail us, or worse—attempt to deceive us—we will have to continue on without their support. I do not fear that possibility. As long as we are together, we will be unstoppable. We can recover what has been stolen from us and procure retribution for that which is irreparable.\n\nWe finally have control over the Darkness and can use it against those who seek to destroy us. All of us now have the means to persevere and win this war. Any Cabal insurrection will be thwarted before it's allowed to endanger. The Vex will be banished to some forgotten time. The Fallen will surrender, or perish. And what of Savathûn and her forces? They will bend until they break into decomposing pieces of refuse. Stasis provides an answer to where we have fallen short previously. Use this power, with me, to abolish our foes and prevent what our forbearers could not. The next Collapse is here, and we must abandon our previous misconceptions of right and wrong.\n\nYou are aware of the stakes, so I will leave you with a word of warning:\n\nThe new Collapse did not come from the Darkness alone. It comes from all around. It comes from within… and the assault has already begun. \n\nThis campaign is far from over, so there is much to prepare for. We will be the masters of our fates once more. I cannot wage this war alone. I need you. All of you. I know what I ask: for you to face the unknown. Use forces beyond our comprehension. This is a world of uncertainty, yet it remains clear—wielding the Darkness with righteous intent will be our true salvation. Will we unite?"

        "text": "The Ghost hovered a few meters above the small campfire and tried, again, to explain the rules. The Lightbearer chewed on a bit of tough gray root. He had softened it over the fire and its sour flavor had mellowed into something approaching black pepper. To his surprise, he found himself enjoying it.\n\nHe interrupted his Ghost.\n\n\"You've explained how it's supposed to work, and I've explained that I don't care,\" he said with playful finality. \"I don't like any of the names you've suggested. And either we both get new names, or neither of us do.\"\n\nThe Ghost flew down to eye level, where its shell appeared iridescent purple in the firelight. \"I have had several good names already,\" it replied. \"I enjoyed some of them quite a bit.\"\n\nThe Lightbearer shook his head. \"You said I had a name before as well, but you won't tell me what it was.\"\n\n\"Can't,\" it corrected him. The Lightbearer fell silent.\n\nThe Ghost emitted a static sigh. \"Purely as a hypothetical exercise,\" it said carefully, \"what would you name me?\"\n\n\"You are… a light in the darkness,\" the Lightbearer began, and paused. He stumbled over the sudden weight of his words.\n\nFrom the beginning, this little Ghost had been the only thing keeping him going. It seemed every Guardian he met had little interest in him except to hold him accountable for the unknown sins of his past, but this almost unbearably earnest Ghost had mended him again and again.\n\nIt nourished him with its encouragement and its inexplicable single-minded faith in him. It showed him compassion. Sometimes, when he writhed awake with a hot knot of nameless anxiety in his belly, the Ghost would rest on his chest and hum to him until he fell back to sleep.\n\nThe Lightbearer took a breath to regain his composure. \"And thus, I name thee Sparky.\"\n\nThe Ghost emitted a pained groan, contracted in the air, and fell to the ground, where it lay facedown in the leaf litter.\n\nThe Lightbearer smiled. \"I'm sensing some reluctance, Sparky.\"\n\nThe Ghost gave the barest pulse and rolled itself over in the leaves—a tiny, lazy movement. It dimmed its light to a bare flicker. \"It's terrible,\" it said flatly.\n\n\"Picky,\" the Lightbearer sniffed. \"Very well. I can do better.\" The Ghost warily resumed hovering.\n\n\"How do you feel about Gleam?\" he asked. \"Flash? Or maybe Glint?\"\n\n\"Glint?\" A rainbow of colors played across the Ghost's eye. This usually meant he was calculating complex enemy behavior, determining combat outcomes, or mapping hundreds of bullets and their millions of possible trajectories. \"Oh, I like Glint!\"\n\nThe Lightbearer drew to his feet by the fire and bowed deeply. \"Then it is an honor to meet you, Master Glint.\" He reached out a finger and wiggled one of Glint's points in greeting. The absurdity of the gesture delighted the little Ghost.\n\n\"And now that you have a name,\" said the Lightbearer, \"perhaps I will be more open to ideas as we search for mine.\" Glint dipped in the air, acknowledging his partner's progress. The pair smothered their fire earlier than usual that night.\n\nThe next morning, a passer-by saw Glint's Lightbearer without his helmet. The Titan beat him mercilessly with her flaming hammer, snapping his collarbone and crushing his pelvis. He died hours later of internal hemorrhage. Glint brought him back and the pair traveled in silence for a long while."

        "text": "The Ether pipes rattled their arrhythmic beat as they greeted a new arrival in the Spider's lair.\n\nHe entered with hesitance. Gold eyes flitted around the room like a nervous animal. His clothes were those of a traitor. The white shawl of a funerary covering draped across shoulders that hunched downward as if a heavy burden rested on them. He was thin from hunger, broken by the cruelty of a face he did not recognize, but others reviled. Out of \"compassion\" he was given a space to rest: a modicum of privacy amid the rattling pipes.\n\nThe Spider, with one hand at his mouth, perched so far forward on his throne that it dipped down toward the floor. \"Nothing? \" he asked one of his lieutenants, who offered a wordless shake of his head in response.\n\n\"And you're sure? This isn't just some…\" Spider waved one hand in the air, as if gesturing to his point. \"Some clever ruse?\" The silence that Spider was met with may as well have been a resounding affirmative.\n\n\"Fascinating.\" Spider grunted as he slid forward off of his throne. He landed on the floor with surprising grace, but when he walked, it was with an ambling gait—a feigned weakness. He dismissed his lieutenant with a flippant gesture and traipsed toward the nearby storage room. The pipes were quieter in there, but only just.\n\nSeated on the floor, wrapped in the tattered white cloth of his burial shroud, the man once known as Prince Uldren Sov looked up to the wide shadow Spider cast in the doorway. He rose to his feet, then bowed. \"Baron,\" he said mistakenly, unaware that Spider neither held no such a title, nor led a great house. Spider's response was a smug laugh, though he tried to temper it behind smiling words.\n\n\"You look like the underside of a Dreg's boot,\" Spider opined as he glided into the room with a silence that belied his stooped posture and uneven gait. His guest—a Lightbearer, no less—turned to his Ghost in a moment of uncertainty.\n\n\"We've had better days,\" was the Ghost's response. Spider restrained himself from criticizing the Ghost for intruding on the conversation and pointedly ignored him.\n\n\"My boys said they found you adrift in space, that your ship ran into some… debris,\" Spider said. \"Awful generous of them to… retrieve you.\" The Spider circled, slowly, blue eyes glowing in the gloom of the dimly lit space. Up close, he carefully assessed the Lightbearer's posture, his expressions, and even something as intimate and subtle as his scent. \"How long were you trapped up there, in the vacuum? Dying and being reborn… over and over again?\"\n\nThe Lightbearer slouched, and his gold eyes averted to the floor at the memory. \"Long enough to know what eternity feels like. Long enough to know I'd never escape without…\" he looked up to Spider, to the glow of those Ether-infused eyes. \"Without help.\"\n\n\"That's me,\" Spider said eagerly, \"very helpful. Very helpful indeed.\" Now sure that the Lightbearer didn't recognize him, Spider ambled up close and took an assessing look at his new guest. \"I don't think I caught your name,\" he added—one final test.\n\n\"I…\" The Lightbearer didn't know how to answer. His Ghost was silent too. \"I don't have one.\" It took all of Spider's energy not to burst out in gleeful laughter.\n\n\"Well, that won't do,\" Spider insisted as he laid a hand on the Lightbearer's shoulder. \"That won't do at all. I won't have someone in my care…\" and Spider was careful to emphasize that word, \"without a proper name.\"\n\nWith a sly tone, Spider moved in closer and suggested, \"How about we try one out? Just for a little while. You and me.\" His voice lowered, gravely and hushed. \"What do you think about… Crow?\"\n\nThe Lightbearer's eyes showed no recognition. The Spider's shone with predatory intent."

        "text": "The Warlock could handle the war beasts. The Cabal Legionaries were slow enough that she could thin their numbers in the open. Even the massive Centurion wouldn't be an issue once it was alone. But there were three Psions up on the ridge with their rifles trained on her position, and if she moved from behind her boulder, she was finished.\n\nDruis knelt in the coarse red sand and cursed under her breath. She hadn't expected this much opposition. She didn't have the energy to teleport. Getting out of this was going to be painful.\n\nShe took a deep breath, formed a roiling Void grenade in her hand, and—\n\nAn explosion erupted from somewhere on the ridge. Gunshots – not the ozone pop of Cabal Slug Rifles, but the sweet crack of old-fashioned black powder.\n\nThe Centurion barked orders at the Legionaries, but panic quickly won out over commands. Druis heard their guttural cries as something picked them off. Another explosion and the baying war beasts fell quiet.\n\nThe gunfire drew closer, the Centurion bellowed… and then nothing.\n\nDruis cautiously poked her head out from behind her boulder. The Cabal squad lay in heaps around the gully. Remnants of Psions littered the ridge. The air was heavy with thick smoke and the smell of black oil.\n\nIn the midst of the carnage, a lone Hunter holstered his weapon and stepped over a corpse. He walked with tight efficiency; no movement wasted. He was graceful, even for a Hunter. Druis stepped into the open and raised a hand in greeting.\n\n\"'Hoy, Guardian!\" she called. \"I appreciate your handiwork! The name's Druis, and you just saved me a lot of trouble.\"\n\nThe Hunter's expression was hidden by his heavy helmet. He gave a perfunctory wave and knelt to examine the Centurion's weapon.\n\nNow that she was standing, Druis realized she was a full head taller than the Hunter. Suppose everyone seems tall when you're cowering behind a rock, she thought.\n\nShe pulled off her helmet and let the fresh air cool her slate-blue skin. Her dark hair limply unfurled from where it was piled atop her head. She fixed the Hunter with her golden eyes and smiled.\n\n\"I signed up for a simple salvage run,\" she said. \"Transmat some supplies, run 'em to the City. I've had a headache all morning and didn't want anything loud.\"\n\nThe Hunter nodded without looking up and pulled a sparking catalyst from a Slug Rifle.\n\nDruis chuckled. \"It's okay,\" she said, nudging the body of a fallen Legionary with her boot. \"You don't have to talk when you can shoot like that.\"\n\nThe Hunter paused, then stood and faced her.\n\n\"I am… they call me Crow,\" he said, \"and I am glad I could be of some help.\"\n\nThe Hunter's voice was soft and refined, and while it had a frosty edge, it was not unfriendly.\n\n\"Not as glad as I am,\" Druis said. \"The last thing I needed today was to take a rez with this headache. I told the Cabal that, but they wouldn't listen. Rude of 'em.\"\n\nCrow laughed politely. \"That I can understand. After being brought back, I feel out of sorts for hours.\"\n\nHe turned to look for more Cabal weapons and something caught the Warlock's eye. She whooped. The Hunter looked up, ready.\n\n\"I'll be damned!\" cried Druis, pointing to his arm. \"You're Reefborn, aren't you? Earthborn here, but you and me, we still go way back!\"\n\nCrow looked down. A strip of leather had been torn from his gauntlet, and beneath it, his own grey-blue Awoken skin could clearly be seen.\n\nWhen he looked up, Druis had nearly closed the distance between them in a few long strides. His hand hovered over his weapon before the Warlock clapped him on the back.\n\n\"Figured you for one. It was your voice and the way you move.\" The tall woman playfully juked from side to side.\n\nCrow was quiet.\n\nDruis wished she could see the helmeted Hunter's expression. To her relief, there was a beep from the tracker on her belt.\n\n\"Finally, some good news,\" she said. \"We're right on top of the supply coordinates.\" She scanned the area and located the tiny supply ship half-hidden by a rockslide. \"Since you kept this cargo out of the hands of the Cabal, I'd say you're entitled to a cut.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Crow said. He shifted his weight and hid his exposed arm behind his back. It was the first awkward movement Druis had seen him make.\n\n\"I didn't say it was necessary,\" she replied. \"Just a kindness between two bright-eyed Awoken. Won't be a minute.\"\n\nShe ducked into the sand-filled hold of the tiny ship and found the shipping crates. Dim red lights blinked on their panels—the seals had broken long ago. She pried the lid off of the closest one. Inside the grime-covered bottles, the liquid still shone with a gentle orange glow. She uncorked one, wiped the neck clean against her vestments, and took a sip. It was bright with honey and salt and burned her throat with a clean, gingery sweetness.\n\n\"We're in luck!\" Druis called as she hopped outside with the bottle. But the Hunter was gone.\n\nDruis placed the bottle on a flat stone and took a seat next to it. Though she did not expect her companion to return, she waited, busying herself by picking dried blood from the velvety hem of her garment. Finally, she sighed, slapped her palms on her thighs, and reached for the drink.\n\n\"To Crow,\" she shrugged."

        "text": "He wasn't afraid of the Scorn at first.\n\nLike anyone else who could spare the bullets, Crow had picked off a few dozen at distance when he found them in the open. Glint had told him they were related to Eliksni somehow, which made sense—they moved like Eliksni—but they just wouldn't stay dead.\n\nWhen their raiding party hit one of the Baron's storehouses, he immediately sent Crow after them. He said the Scorn were \"bad for business,\" but Crow could tell by his benefactor's wet wheezing he wanted revenge.\n\nCrow was stealthy. Careful. But the Scorn could smell, or sense, or something. He was forced to move deeper into their territory, picking his way through welded-together ship husks as the creatures searched for him.\n\nThey had herded him into a kill box: a derelict ship with one way out. Then they started coming inside—and Crow found he much preferred fighting them from hundreds of yards away.\n\nThe Scorn were rotting flesh pressed tight beneath metal, their bodies webbed with scars and fields of boils, malformed flaps of muscle bolted crudely into place, clumps of brown cloth balled into weeping sockets.\n\nCrow reloaded his revolver and dropped three of the smaller ones. Their helmets were thinner, or their bone structure softer—either way, one shot was all it took. The air was filled with the sour smell of wounds festering beneath brass.\n\nChains dragged against metal to his left and Crow spun. A hulking form was pulling its way through a gap in the ship's hull.\n\nCrow fired. Some of the blue pustules that ringed the creature's shoulder burst open. A thin gas rose from the wound and released an acrid smell of cold solvent. He unloaded into the thing's body, corking the tunnel with its corpse.\n\nTwo Stalkers pressed through another gap and moved to flank him. He backpedaled and reloaded, fully aware he was being pushed farther into the corridors of the ship. He turned in time to catch sight of a flaming thurible and ducked, but it collided with the side of his head. His ears rang and his revolver clattered to the floor.\n\nThe Stalkers hooted in excitement as something tackled him. It was one of the big Raiders, its four ropy arms bound with filthy belts. He struggled and felt the leather straps along its forearms twist and crunch. They were caked with dried lymph.\n\nThe Raider was on top of him, mouth howling below its featureless metal faceplate, pinning him to the ground with its larger arms while the smaller two tried to bring its rifle up for a shot.\n\nA jagged claw tore through Crow's cheek as he writhed and kicked in the Raider's grasp. He wrestled the rifle away from his chin and forced it in the direction of the two Stalkers. He groped blindly until his fingers found the trigger; the burst of fire hit the Stalkers and they fell in a screeching heap.\n\nThe Raider roared and twisted the rifle from Crow's grip and flung it away. Freed of the weapon, its frenzied subarms tore at Crow's stomach. He felt claws catch and tear his own leathers, and then they were through, and his waist was slick with blood.\n\nGibbering madly, it pulled him closer to its misshapen teeth. Thin mucus poured from somewhere under the metal faceplate. Down through the thing's lipless chittering mouth. Down into Crow's face.\n\nAnd then he realized the creature was speaking.\n\nThere was a long moment of horror followed by one of pure revulsion. It was one thing to be torn apart by a mindless creature of madness, but this… this would not be allowed.\n\nCrow felt the Light surrounding him more solidly than the arms of the Raider. He kicked off the creature as if underwater and felt his torn stomach lurch.\n\nThe Raider's arms closed on nothing. It looked up in rage as Crow's shifting form tumbled away.\n\nWith one hand down on the rusty deck of the craft, Crow steadied himself. The Light rose from his body like steam. Knife, he thought, and some of the dissipating energy became a blade in his hand.\n\nHe stood. The Raider charged forward, clawed hands clattering against the ground as it skittered toward him. Crow feinted left and pulled his arm across his body, then pivoted and dropped to a knee as he let the knife go.\n\nThe blade was in the creature's chest and the blade was Light and the creature became flame.\n\nThe smoke was pure, the ash clean.\n\nThe Light was Crow's weapon, and as he walked out of the ship, it was the Light that roared again and again and again from his hand.\n\nIt was the Light that drew Glint to Crow as he walked like a pillar of flame in the night.\n\nAnd it was the Light that kept Crow from madness, even as the voice of the thing echoed through his mind:\n\n\"fatherfatherfatherfatherfather\""

(But as private ownership of such an unstable isotope was utterly forbidden, Glint decided it must be a replica.)\n\nHe found Spider working a bank of consoles in the nexus of the depot. An intricate series of gravity currents filled the air with gently gliding cargo. Rusty iris gates snapped open and shut as Spider directed his goods to unseen corners of his dominion.\n\n\"Tell me about Crow,\" Spider said without looking up. Glint flew closer and caught sight of himself on a small monitor. He saw a mosaic of security feeds—corridors in the Tangled Shore, a strange workshop, Crow's quarters—before Spider collapsed the images and turned to address him directly. \"How has our friend been performing in the field?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" Glint answered. \"He's feeling more confident, while—\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Spider dismissively. He plucked a cracked chunk of Seraphite from the current of air as it passed, ran his claws over it, then placed it back in the beam. \"Has anyone told him?\"\n\nGlint didn't have to ask for clarification. \"Not outright. He knows he wasn't a good person—he gathered that much from the Guardians who killed him—but he hasn't heard his old name.\"\n\nSpider gave a phlegmy grunt of contentment. \"And there haven't been any indiscretions?\"\n\nGlint's eye flickered and he made an almost imperceptible processing noise. Spider leaned forward. \"Do you have something to tell me?\"\n\n\"It's actually a funny story,\" Glint said. \"He ran across a Warlock who recognized him as an Awoken, and she—\"\n\n\"He was seen?\" Spider shouted, striking the side of a passing crate. A chorus of mewling squeaks rose from within. Glint watched as it floated out of sight.\n\n\"Not seen,\" Glint said. \"She noticed his skin under his gauntlet. He told me he didn't want to risk further exposure, so he left.\"\n\n\"Then he's lying, Glint. Even to you.\" The light in Spider's eyes seemed to dull. One of his smaller arms scratched irritably at his side.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time,\" Glint said softly. \"People talk behind his back. There are rumors someone named Chalco has been following him. He's heard the Scorn call him 'father.' He'll eventually figure it out.\"\n\n\"I gave him rules for a reason.\"\n\n\"Following rules is counter to his nature,\" Glint said blithely, then noticed Spider's scowl. \"Frustrating, I know. He could ask anything of the next Guardian he sees, and I couldn't stop him.\"\n\nSpider growled. \"You will stop him.\"\n\n\"The thing is,\" said Glint, \"someday he'll realize who he was doesn't matter. What's important is who he is.\"\n\n\"Who he is,\" Spider hissed, \"is my investment. I'm counting on you to remind him of that fact.\" A damaged crate floated past, loose Glimmer swirling in the gravity beam behind it.\n\nThe little Ghost was quiet. He floated unsteadily for a moment, then rose to Spider's eye level.\n\n\"Baron Spider,\" Glint said respectfully, \"in his short new life, Crow has faced more than his share of cruelty. He learned what it is to truly suffer.\"\n\nGlint mistook Spider's contempt for contemplation and continued.\n\n\"He isn't afraid of being hurt anymore. If you want him to stay,\" he said helpfully, \"you'll need to offer him more than threats.\"\n\nSpider looked at the impertinent little orb and rage welled up inside him. But he was old, and he was smart. He let the anger flow over him, around him, floated in its black waters until only his eyes were left peering over the surface.\n\n\"Thank you, Glint,\" he said, his voice calm. \"I will call for you again if I need you.\"\n\nGlint beeped with pride, dipped in the air respectfully, and zipped away through the stacks of contraband."

The Spider looked up and wordlessly beckoned the Lightbearer over. Upon reaching the throne, Crow took a knee.\n\n\"What was it we talked about before you left?\" Spider's rhetorical question sat like a weight of stones on Crow's shoulders. Crow didn't look up, and when he started to answer, Spider cut him off.\n\n\"Guardians can't be trusted,\" was Spider's reminder. \"They can be useful, they can be powerful, but never trusted.\"\n\n\"Baron, I only thought to—\"\n\n\"No!\" Spider bellowed. \"You didn't! If you thought about anything, you wouldn't have exposed…\" Spider caught himself, words turning into a snarled grumble as he laid back in his throne. \"You screwed up.\"\n\nCrow, head bowed and eyes fixed on the floor, said nothing. He knew the Spider's anger, knew his displeasure, and knew his wrath. He held no desire to face it again.\n\n\"But maybe there's some…\" the Spider hesitated and chose his words carefully, \"…wisdom, in your defiance. The Guardians are too good a resource to cast aside, especially on matters beyond our mutual—ah—expertise.\"\n\nIt was only then that Crow looked up, questioningly. For a moment, he felt humbled pride. Perhaps, he believed, that act of defiance had broken through to Spider, revealed Crow as more than a convenient Lightbearer.\n\nThe Spider held out one hand. \"I have an idea to… protect you.\" His offer sounded sincere, even if Spider meant his investment and not Crow as a person. \"Send Glint over.\"\n\nCrow grew tense, looked away, and then thought better of testing another act of defiance so soon. With a nod, he showed his compliance as Glint manifested at his side. The ghost fixed on Crow with a nervous look, then flew up to Spider.\n\n\"What… do you require?\" Glint asked.\n\nInstead of answering, Spider snatched Glint out of the air with one hand. Glint shrieked and Crow stood swiftly, but just as swiftly saw the Arc-pikes of Spider's guards thrust at him. Spider made a clicking noise in the back of his throat and reached for a set of tools nearby. Tools used to pry open the shells of dead ghosts. They would work on living ones just as well.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\" Glint demanded, fear in his voice. Crow stood frozen, having faced Spider's punishment before. But this… this was his Ghost. A part of Crow also feared that perhaps he was misreading the situation. He was so certain that Spider would never do anything to permanently hurt him. But when the Spider shocked Glint into paralysis with a small, needled tool, Crow was disabused of that certainty.\n\n\"Stop!\" Crow cried as Spider wedged a flat tool between Glint's shell plates. \"No!\"\n\nWith a snap, Spider popped one of the casings off. Then he looked up to Crow and switched tools.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" the Spider said in soothing reassurance that flowed like ice through Crow's veins. \"I'm just going to make some… modifications,\" he said, igniting a cutting torch.\n\n\"To better protect you… from the world.\""

For all his strength as a Lightbearer, he looked small seated on the floor in his den, illuminated by the pale glow of a solitary lamp. Crow cradled Glint in his cupped hands. The ghost's monocular eye stared up at him and flickered weakly. \"I'm so, so sorry.\"\n\n\"It's all right.\" Glint couldn't blame Crow. \"I—I think I'll be fine. Spider is…\" he had to cautiously choose his next words, \"…very skilled with modifying Ghost architecture.\"\n\n\"He put a bomb inside you!\" Crow hissed, his voice cracking.\n\n\"But I'm still here. Still with you,\" Glint reassured. \"And you still have the Light. That's what matters.\"\n\nCrow looked up to the ceiling, unable to bear the sight of the damage done to his Ghost. He was silent, the room was silent, save for the damnable rattling of those pipes. \"I put you in this position,\" Crow said quietly. \"I let this happen.\"\n\n\"You had no choice. We can't change the past,\" Glint said as he floated up out of Crow's hands a little crookedly; like a bird with an injured wing. \"We can only look to the future.\"\n\nCrow forced himself to gaze down into Glint's single, flickering eye. \"My future is with you. You're all I have. The only person who…\" he lowered his voice, afraid Spider might overhear them. \"The only person who cares about me.\"\n\n\"You won't ever know who cares about you until you meet them,\" Glint contested, then floated closer to Crow's face. \"You aren't a prisoner,\" he added. \"You… you could leave. Live a normal life. Without the Light.\"\n\nCrow's jaw tensed, teeth clenched together. \"No,\" he said through them. \"I won't abandon you. You would never do that to me.\"\n\nThe Ghost looked away in thought for a moment and then bobbed up and down. \"You're right,\" he said as he turned again to face his Lightbearer. Glint floated in and softly tapped his shell to Crow's nose. \"I'll never leave you.\"\n\nCrow reached out and gently took Glint into the palm of his hand. \"We're all we have,\" Crow whispered, pulling his knees in close, and Glint even closer.  \"Spider will never let us go…\"\n\n\"…but at least we have each other.\""

        "text": "He comes to Europa almost the size of an Archon priest, but hollow. He needs Ether. If touched, he fears he will crumble into nothing. His arms will dock themselves, his skin will shed. He has nothing except his armor and the thousand-year-old loom clutched in his four arms.\n\nThey mockingly name him \"Namrask,\" which means \"empty weaver.\" Like naming a Human \"Norman,\" which, he understands, means \"not really Human.\"\n\nEramis separates all the newcomers so they will not retain their old pre-Dusk loyalties. Namrask is shoved into a little warren carved beneath the ice; the moon's surface is so radioactive that not even Eliksni can live there for long.\n\nThe little Winterdrekhs are kind to him. Namrask realizes that they think he is too weak to earn the huge Ether ration he needs. He has been put in this warren to die.\n\n\"I can work,\" he rasps. \"I can make bandages, capes, armor lining, eggcloth, supsoak, prayer matting, watercloth. I am a weaver!\"\n\n\"Tall friend,\" one of the Winterdrekhs says soberly. \"No one your size is a weaver. Why not volunteer to fight for Eramis?\"\n\nNamrask shudders. He cannot fight. Not after what he saw in the Reef—that THING with its staff. Not after SIVA, Twilight Gap, London. Kridis promised that this was salvation.\n\n\"Bring me broken eggs,\" Namrask begs, \"and I will make eggcloth. How will the hatchlings be swaddled if no one weaves the eggcloth for them?\"\n\nThe Drekhs watch as he uses his teeth to separate the eggshell from the thin, fibrous membrane beneath. He tears it into long fibers and fastens them to his loom as the warp—the threads that run top to bottom. With two hands, he holds the loom in his lap. Carefully, he chisels open the warp with a third hand; moving too quickly will snap the eggthread.\n\nHis life depends on this. His fourth hand swiftly passes the shuttle through the warp, drawing the first weft across. The thread does not snap; he has woven.\n\n\"Watch me,\" he tells the Drekhs. \"When Eramis is done conquering our enemies, we must know how to make things.\"\n\nThey sit and watch. Their lower arms, half-grown after docking, mimic his motions. Their names are Eoriks, Oeriks, and Yriks: brother, brother, and sister.\n\nWhen it is done, he gives them the little scrap of eggcloth. They murmur in wonder and rub their cheeks against it. \"Bring that to the camp Captain,\" he tells them. \"Tell them that Namrask can weave if he is fed and given fiber.\"\n\nIt is the first time he has ever made anything without ruining it on the loom."

        "text": "When Namrask has the strength, he uses nonfluid loop cutters to help the Drekhs join their icy tunnels with other habitats. He weaves hollowhot matting to insulate the tunnels, and soon, some places are warm enough to remove a little armor. A clutch of eggs is hatched, and the hatchlings are raised in the warren.\n\nFor the first time since he fled the Tangled Shore, Namrask can think of more than his own survival.\n\nThen the warrior Phylaks, a lieutenant of Eramis, comes recruiting.\n\nOn the raw ice beneath a black sky, she plays videos of Eramis raising a slab of crystal like a wall; another where she binds a Vex Minotaur in a casket of frost.\n\n\"This is the future of all Eliksni. Who among you would wield this power?\" she asks.\n\nHe keeps his head down.\n\n\"You.\"\n\nNamrask looks up, carefully. Phylaks's shock pistol is pressed to his brow. She puts the weapon down between them, a sign of truce, and makes the ireliis bow of respect. \"You have the size of an old fighter. Why not come forward?\"\n\nHe is afraid his voice will fail. It comes out strong, but like another's voice: \"I saw what happened the last time Eliksni reached for new power. And the time before that, and the time before that. I will not be part of it.\"\n\nShrugging, Phylaks takes up her pistol and walks away. \"There are many others who will take your place.\"\n\nLater, Yriks tries to change his mind, but Namrask refuses again. \"Eramis derives authority from her ability to grant this power. She cannot give it to everyone; if she does, her authority is lost,\" he says. \"Has she destroyed Servitors?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Yriks says quietly. \"Drekhtalk says that she broke a Servitor during a ritual to give power. To show that the old ways are done.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" \n\nWill society always be based on violence? Where the basic worker is not the weaver, the farmer, or the healer, but the Drekh: one pistol, one knife, one unit of labor. Employed to steal what it can—the value of a Drekh life.\n\nAnd Namrask helped make that law.\n\nHe rumbles. \"She preaches salvation, but she cannot save everyone. She keeps Ether scarce. More than we can get alone, but not as much as we need. It is the way to rule.\"\n\n\"You have a mind for strategy,\" Yriks observes slyly. \"Who were you before you became our empty weaver?\"\n\n\"Do you know hollowhot's secret?\" he asks and abruptly places some on the ground for a chattering little hatchling to play gathering-games without freezing to the ice. \"Why it is so valuable as insulation?\"\n\n\"What is hollowhot's secret, Namrask? Why is it so valuable?\" She mocks him. \n\nNamrask shows her one thread of the stuff, end-on, so she can see the little bubbles of vacuum that fill the center.\n\n\"There is nothing inside it,\" he says. \"But if you pry too hard, you break the nothing. And then it is useless.\""

Namrask realizes this is not a new Eliksni paradise; it is a very old one. And it always falls.\n\n\"Do something,\" Yriks begs him. \"We will all die here if you do not.\"\n\n\"No,\" Namrask grunts, picking at his loom. He is afraid that if he goes near Eramis, he will accept her gift.\n\n\"Do something,\" Eoriks begs him. \"Find us a protector. You must have known great warriors, when you were great.\"\n\n\"No,\" Namrask says again. He holds a hatchling to the heat lamp so it can bask in the warmth. He fears that anyone he calls to Europa will join with Eramis.\n\n\"Do something,\" Oeriks begs him. \"Find a way off Iiropa. If what you say is true, then Eramis will damn us all. What are you afraid of?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" he snaps. \"Then I will find us a traitor.\"\n\nFor the first time, Namrask makes the long walk to Riis-Reborn. It is built in the ruins of an old Human city and the angular, crowded architecture makes him growl in fear and bloodlust. He remembers when the Eliksni broke the walls of the Not-Quite-Last City and took what was within.\n\nSniksis and Piksis guard Eramis's chamber. The twins make ireliis to him. \"She will honor you if you honor her, O Great Akh—\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" he growls. Not that stolen name. \"I'm not here for Eramis. Where is Variks?\"\n\nWhen Variks, the old judge, sees Namrask, he laughs. \"I thought you would be in that hole forever.\"\n\n\"You put me there, didn't you?\" \n\n\"Not I, sir.\" Variks claps two hands crosswise, one pair, then the other. \"It was the day-Captain, who had no idea who you really are. Does it suit you to be forgotten, old Smokesword?\"\n\nNamrask grinds his teeth. Laboriously, he lowers himself on all four arms. \"I come to beg a favor.\"\n\n\"No.\" Variks comes closer to whisper. \"My judgment stands, woe-of-the-masses. You gave no mercy and you will get none.\"\n\n\"You make a habit of serving queens who will abandon you,\" Namrask whispers back. \"Eramis is doomed, Variks. She is Whirlwind-touched. As I was, once.\"\n\n\"She knows what she risks. Why else would she have sent her mate and children to another star?\"\n\n\"Athrys is gone?\" Woeful news; she was Eramis's guiding glint. \"You always have a way out. I want a part of it—\"\n\n\"Now you run from battle?\" The judge's voice is light, unmocking; a sincere question. \"When Eramis could make you mighty again?\"\n\n\"I survive now as a Drekh survives. I have hatchlings; I would see them spared.\"\n\n\"There were hatchlings on the ships you abandoned at Riis. Human infants in London—\"\n\n\"I am no longer the killer I was then!\"\n\n\"Yes, you are.\"\n\n\"But I do not want to be! When I was on the Reef, I—\" Namrask struggles. \"I saw the beast Fikrul. Before that, I saw the Devil Splicers. But this debasement of our form, this revenge—it must stop, Variks. Please. Help me.\"\n\n\"No favors,\" the judge pronounces. \"Not for you. However…\"\n\nVariks's prosthetic hand scratches letters in the snow. It takes Namrask several blinks of his second eyes to understand that it is Human script: MITHRAX.\n\n\"I will make your name known to him.\" Variks wipes away the letters. \"But this is not a favor.\" His metal hand touches the tattered blue banners around his waist. \"In exchange, I want these redone in fresh bannercloth. I will send you the thread. You will weave for me, 'Namrask.'\"\n\nNamrask tries his best. But the bannerthread is too fine, the weave too dense, and he cannot complete his task before word comes that Variks has summoned the Guardians—the Machine-spawn—to Europa."

He warns them, \"We must hide close to the Machine-spawn and steal supplies, or radiation and Ether-lack will bring us down.\"\n\nThey leave. But not an hour later, a rifle round punctures Namrask's armor. He barely staggers, but the jet of air and Ether exploding into vacuum thrust him backwards. \"A Guardian,\" he warns. \"It will call its kin.\" Guardians love to gather like carrion eaters over easily slain and looted foes.\n\nAnother round hits Namrask's helmet. \"Those with scattercloth, give me your capes!\" In exchange for the first cape, Namrask shoves his loom into a Vandal's arms. \"But this is priceless,\" she protests. \"You cannot give it!\"\n\n\"I will return for it,\" he promises. Feverishly, Namrask stitches the capes into a blanket as blood trickles down the inside of his armor.\n\nHe fires his shrapnel launcher into the ice to kick up steam: \"Like this!\" he shouts. \"Make a cloud and run!\" They shoot into the ice and flee. As the ice storm settles in Europa's low gravity, Namrask crawls towards the Guardian under a blanket of invisibility. Occasionally, he emerges long enough to be seen, so that the Guardian will hunt him instead of the others.\n\nThe Guardian comes for him. \n\nNamrask huddles against the ice, slowly freezing. The Humans are such gangly mockeries of the Eliksni form: two arms, two eyes in a smooth, lifeless doll-face, stubby little teeth. He remembers the Guardians he has killed—eight times. He has never revered Ghosts.\n\nHe remembers the smell of burning flesh. Ordinary Humans, young and old. Their gardens and structures; their star and world. Forever remembering giving that long-ago order: Burn it. Burn it. Burn it.\n\nThe Guardian nears.\n\nNamrask melts a puddle with his armor's radiators. The Guardian uses a sword tip to test the ice at the edge of Namrask's cover. Namrask makes one small sound: I do not want to die yet.\n\nA shock pistol burst scatters off the Guardian's armor. They whirl, sword down, rifle up; sights on Yriks. Foolish, brave Yriks, scurrying on all sixes, like a Drekh. She has saved him. \n\nThe Guardian mocks her, saying, \"Ooh, bonyenne, tu m'as tiré! Tu voulais mon attention? Ben tu vas l'avwère!\" \n\nTheir vehicle appears; the Guardian mounts it and pursues Yriks. Namrask never sees her again."

You should have stayed with the others…escaped…\"\n\n\"I had to give your loom back,\" the Vandal says. She drops it on his wounded chest. He bellows.\n\nAs days pass, the radio shrieks with distant transmissions. Encrypted tactical data between Servitors. Eramis's sermons. The song of the red world overhead. And occasionally, the bray of Human tongues, as a Guardian brags of a new conquest, or curses some obscene glory-trial amusement.\n\nPhylaks is dead; Praksis too. \n\nThe Priestess Kridis is dead—Sniksis and Piksis with her—and the Prime Servitor is destroyed.\n\nEramis is dead, consumed by her own power. One of the old Riis-born. Never will there be another.\n\nNamrask knew it would end this way. He has seen this every time. His fallen people have learned defeat so well that now they defeat themselves. He rages and claws at the ice.\n\nFor his band of stranded survivors, he fashions shelters of watercloth: synthetic skin with thick bladders pumped full of ice to block some of the radiation. When his wound pains him, he numbs it on the ice. Turrha sees him but says nothing. He is grateful. \n\n\"We must find a transmitter,\" he says. \"We must call for Misraaks to return.\"\n\nBut survivors are still on Europa.

Eoriks leaps to him and tries to capture the escaping puff of Ether—what old faith would call the passage of his soul—as if this will keep Oeriks alive.

After Chelchis fell, I sent ships to follow the Great Machine. I abandoned all those Houses that could not make war. I ordered my fleet to hunt the Machine. Many rallied after us. Each ship began its own war with the Humans. But maybe, I was first.\"\n\nMisraaks stares at him. Finally, he says, \"I understand. Our people fear the Saint too. But I doubt the Saint ever knew them by name.\"\n\n***\n\nNamrask settles in the area of the Last City that has been given to the Eliksni. By day, he shares a loom with others. By night, he whispers the names of those he has lost until he falls asleep.\n\nHe sleeps well until the day a Human shouts at him: \"Baby eater!\"\n\nNamrask turns away. But he wants to shout back. About the closed air, closed life of a spacecraft. About the hatchlings who survived and the hard decisions about those who did not. He wished now they had been depraved enough to think of devouring Human young.\n\nBut he sees the young Eliksni, like Eido. He wants to wail at their promise, at their hope. Eido dislikes and avoids him, which is for the best.\n\nEventually, Namrask learns to weave for the Humans. His favorite task is making felt, but he also learns to work in silk. He likes the silkmaker, and runs it manually sometimes, pulling the thread from the spinneret with one hand and then another, maintaining the steady, even tension, which makes the best fabric.\n\nHe wishes that he could weave in Light, like the Guardian Warlocks, who make fieldweave in a secret way. Maybe Misraaks will learn how to do that.\n\nOne day, a machine comes to his market stall. He combs at his shell nervously. The machine-Humans are called \"Exos.\" They remind him of the Vex; it is easier to look at their armored shapes than the unsettling softness of the Humans and two-souled Awoken. This Exo wears a colorful mantle.\n\n\"I recognize you,\" the machine says.\n\nHe quails. \"Namrask sells fabrics,\" he croaks, pretending not to understand.\n\n\"Namrask.\" She laughs quietly. \"I am old, empty weaver. Almost as old as you, I think. But unlike most of my kind, I remember London—and you.\"\n\nHe holds a bolt of fabric between them. She catches two of his hands: her machine flesh is warmer than his.\n\n\"Timelines are born from each moment—we live on one thread woven into a vast tapestry. But what has happened between us, on this thread, is fixed. You cannot run from it. You are a butcher. You and I are still at war,\" she rasps.\n\nShe releases his hands. He stares at her, breathing hard. Ether smokes from his mouth.\n\nShe playfully taps on all four of his hands. \"I am named for an ancient goddess,\" she says, \"with as many arms as you. In her hands are dharma, kama, artha, and moksha. Law, desire, meaning, and finally, liberation. Freedom from the war of death and rebirth. Are you freed by your rebirth as Namrask?\"\n\nHe repeats, \"Namrask sells fabrics.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" There is laughter in her voice. \"But I do not think moksha has granted you true rebirth.\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten what you did when you were Akileuks. And I never will,\" she says quietly.\n\nHe stole that name, like any other plunder, and used it. A Human hero's name, a great warrior and famous runner: Achilles, which means \"woe to the enemy.\""

Looks clear.\"\n\nShe stepped through a rusted doorway into a courtyard—the wind whistled through the torn seams of decrepit structures and raindrops crackled on loose metal plating. She walked through the muddy soil and stopped where the Bergusia Forge used to stand.\n\n\"Curses,\" Ada spat.\n\nHer hands fidgeted as her gaze wandered aimlessly around the nearly barren landscape. Artemis-5 perched on a broken pillar, her scope methodically rotating through doorways and windows while her Ghost floated patiently overhead; the other two members of Ada's escort lounged against a broken wall to the rear, silently watching the Black Armorer. She looked back, studying their featureless helmet plates, then quickly turned away. Her foot clanked against something hard and metallic—she stooped down and picked up a forgotten slab of Black Armory alloy, a remnant of the lost forge.\n\nArtemis kicked into the comms again. \"That Forge tech? Any clues of what happened here?\"\n\nAda sighed as she studied it. \"Scorch cannon sears, wire rifle cuts, kinetic ricochet marks.\"\n\n\"Almost like there's been years of combat here,\" Artemis quipped sarcastically.\n\n\"How astute,\" Ada said dryly. \"There's nothing more to glean here.\" She took a deep breath, a useless gesture in her Exo body but a compulsion nonetheless.\n\n\"Sun's fading, \"Artemis said. \"Devrim's got eyes on a Fallen raiding party. Not headed our way yet, but I'd rather not take chances. You have what you need?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" Ada said. \"But we won't find much else—this area has been thoroughly scavenged, same as the others.\"\n\n\"Fallen?\" Artemis asked.\n\n\"With no Guardians bothering to stop them? Could have been anyone.\"\n\nArtemis winced. \"I can only imagine how you must feel. The Vanguard had a tough call to make… planetary evacs came first.\"\n\n\"And now they're on to exciting new frontiers, while I'm left with nothing but rubbish,\" Ada said, her voice full of false cheerfulness.\n\nArtemis leapt down from her vantage point and placed a hand on Ada's arm.\n\nAda's shoulders slumped. \"I am glad for the evacuations. I shouldn't have—\"\n\nA howl echoed from somewhere in the complex. Artemis readied her rifle, and one of the escort squad entered the comm channel. \"Pikes changed heading. We should get her out.\"\n\n\"Are you ready?\" Artemis asked.\n\nAda studied the broken slab of metal in her hand, turning it over and tracing its jagged edges. \"I'm not sure,\" she said, tightly clutching the piece of debris. \"But what choice do I have?\""

She placed the tool down and grabbed the piece of alloy in her hand, testing the bond's strength. The actuators in her fingers whirred with effort, but as her focus shifted to the open tome on her desk, the metal promptly snapped. Ada let out an exasperated groan—two more pieces of detritus dropped on an already cluttered floor.\n\n\"Did you forget to measure twice?\" a voice called out from behind. Ada whirled around as Hawthorne sauntered into the hall.\n\n\"Isn't that saying based on woodworking?\" Ada asked flatly.\n\nHawthorne shrugged. \"Don't have any welding jokes.\" She gingerly stepped over a tangle of cables. \"Great work environment you've got; love the décor.\"\n\nAda turned to her tome with intense focus. \"Can I help you with something?\"\n\nHawthorne chuckled. \"I was going to ask you that. Heard the cursing all the way up the stairwell.\"\n\n\"Can you interpret Armory schematics and machine the parts needed to assemble them?\" Ada answered, without looking up.\n\n\"Unlikely,\" Hawthorne said.\n\n\"Can you convince Zavala to stop asking me when a forge will be operational again?\"\n\nHawthorne puffed her cheeks and exhaled. \"Even less likely.\"\n\nAda quickly flipped a page of the tome. The paper snapped, nearly tearing. \"Sounds like the answer to your question is no.\"\n\n\"Is that why you're doing this? Vanguard orders?\"\n\nAda jabbed a thumb at her own chest. \"The Forges were—ARE—my legacy.  It's my responsibility to continue their operation. Zavala's desires are tangential.\"\n\nHawthorne stepped closer to Ada's workstation. \"Help me out here. I'm not super familiar with your illustrious organization's history—was the Armory born of a dream to have the world's greatest gun oven?\"\n\nAda sighed. \"The Armory was founded to stand against the Darkness, to shield humanity when we couldn't count on others to do so. The forges were simply the tools we used.\"\n\n\"So much for that grand plan. The Pyramids rolled in, and last I checked, Mars is still missing. Titan. Mercury.\"\n\n\"Did you come down here solely to antagonize me?\" Ada snipped.\n\n\"All right, all right…\" Hawthorne pleaded.  \"Look, I know we aren't friends or anything. I'm not sure you have any of those anyway—\"\n\nAda glowered.\n\n\"Right, sorry,\" Hawthorne said quickly. \"The thing is, people around here talk a big game about putting humanity first, but then it's all Guardians, all the time.\"\n\nAda nodded. \"The devotion to Lightbearers can seem fanatical.\"\n\n\"But you're not like that, Ada.\"\n\nAda shook her head. \"I appreciate the sentiment, Suraya, but I'm not sure how that relates to the forges.\"\n\nHawthorne leaned on Ada's desk. \"I think your voice is important to have around here. I want you to succeed. But you might be holding on to the past too tightly.\"\n\nAda scoffed. \"You presume to tell me how to carry the Armory's legacy?\"\n\nHawthorne gestured to the forge memorabilia strewn about the hall. \"Not at all. But your founders didn't wake up one day with forges on the brain. They started with a problem, then designed a solution as only they could.\"\n\nAda turned, her eyes thoughtful. \"And you're suggesting I'm starting with a solution instead? Limiting my view?\"\n\n\"I'm saying I would understand if it was hard to let go of all of this when it's all you've ever known.\"\n\nAda nodded. \"The idea of leaving the forges behind is admittedly unnerving.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" Hawthorne said. \"But the old methods aren't working. Maybe it's time to carry on your founders' legacy in your own way.\"\n\nAda was silent for a moment. \"I should get back to work. Thank you for your advice.\" She jutted her arm out in a stiff handshake gesture.\n\nHawthorne chuckled and clasped her hand around Ada's. \"Good luck. But maybe try to keep the noise down, okay?

You are none of those things.\"\n\nAda scoffed. \"Don't be ridiculous, I've seen that Drifter perusing this data on a weekly basis for his own amusement.\"\n\n\"That's not— there's no way—\" Rahool stammered and blushed. \"I assure you, no such breach has occurred.\"\n\nAda folded her arms as Rahool continued. \"And even if it had, one crime doesn't excuse another.\"\n\nAda leaned forward assertively. \"I guess you will be of no help then.\"\n\nRahool shrugged. \"Not for two to three weeks, at the very least.\"\n\nAda grunted and stormed off through the Cryptarium's towering doors, their colorful display of cullet glass shining on her shoulders, when she heard Rahool loudly call out after her.\n\n\"What were the names again that you were querying against?\" Rahool asked.\n\n\"Henriette Meyrin, Yuki Satou, and Helga Rasmussen.\"\n\nRahool's eyebrows lifted at the final name. \"You may be in luck.

        "text": "Ada worked to keep pace with her Eliksni guide weaving through the dimly lit and angular maze of the Last City's Eliksni Quarter. The blur of open windows and doors provided brief glimpses into their new guests' lives: Strips of purple fabric filled wash basins. Jars of unknown food clinked against each other as they boiled in oversized pots while parents softly clacked their mandibles and watched their infants nestled in gently used blankets. In the distance, attendants surrounded a humming Servitor.\n\nThe guide entered a basement-level dwelling. Ada followed as they pushed through a rough cotton curtain and stood in a warm and humid room laden with myriad rugs and carpet swatches. The City's ambient glow slipped in through a singular small window while candles flickered in a pastiche of glass vessels. A series of futons had been arranged in a semi-circle in the middle of the room; there, a band of Eliksni lounged on and against the furniture, all listening to the words of a single speaker seated on the floor. The air filled with guttural clicks and low growls that Ada could make no sense of. She finally understood the performance to be over when the audience dispersed and her guide led her to sit beside the scribe.\n\n\"You're the one asking questions about Europa, are you not? About Salvation?\" the scribe said.\n\nAda frowned. \"You speak our language remarkably well.\"\n\n\"I had an unusual upbringing,\" the Eliksni replied. \"I am Eido. What do you seek, Black Armorer?\"\n\nAda sat on a futon, keeping a healthy distance from the Eliksni. \"I'm searching for information from the BrayTech facilities on Europa.\"\n\n\"And you believe we have this?\"\n\n\"I know some of your people defected from House Salvation. They may have seen something.\"\n\nEido nodded. \"They have seen many things.\"\n\n\"One of my forebearers, a great weaponsmith, worked at the Bray facilities on Europa… but I only know a fraction of what she was doing there.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Eido said. \"Always about guns.\"\n\nAda frowned. \"Your people are no strangers to weaponsmithing.\"\n\nEido inhaled. \"True. And now, improbably, both our arsenals stand together in the shadow of the Great Machine.\"\n\n\"An alliance that makes it all the more logical for you to help me,\" Ada said.\n\nEido placed her claws together. \"I will not help, because I cannot. No mentions have been made of anything related to your Armory founders.\"\n\nAda's gaze dropped to the floor.\n\nEido cocked her head and observed the Exo. \"Such despair. Maybe this is about more than guns after all?\"\n\nAda paused briefly. \"I lost something. A part of me.\"\n\nEido nodded solemnly. \"Your forges, yes?\" \n\n\"My whole existence was tied to the Armory. To those forges. Without them, I feel…\"\n\n\"Without purpose?\" Eido finished the thought.\n\nAda shook her head. \"This isn't— I'm not sure you could understand.\"\n\nEido chuckled—a guttural grunt combined with clicking teeth. \"Our history is littered with the banners of lost Houses. Most of us have worn more than one color, knelt before Kell after Kell, hoping that they would be the last.\" She leaned closer to Ada. \"Eliksni understand the fluidity of purpose very well.\"\n\n\"Fluidity implies a continuation,\" Ada replied. She sighed heavily. \"But it seems my path is coming to an end.\"\n\nClicks resonated in Eido's jaw. \"Devils was a dead House, until Eramis made it new. Mithrax was Dusk, and now, he is Light. Paths only end when we stop walking.\"\n\nAda studied the Eliksni. \"This is not the conversation I was expecting.\"\n\n\"If this settlement is going to work, it's probably best to break from old expectations,\" Eido said.\n\nAda nodded and looked at the light softly radiating through the window. \"I've taken enough of your time. Thank you,\" she said and confidently extended her arm with sincere gratitude.\n\nA clawed hand landed softly on her shoulder as the Eliksni instead thrust her datapad into Ada's outstretched hand. The befuddled Exo quickly parsed the screen.\n\n\"This is something we found in the Bray archives. It is not what you were looking for, but it may help you decide where to walk next,\" Eido said.\n\n\"I—I'll look into it, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Eido replied as Ada stood and slid the datapad under her arm. She hesitated.\n\n\"Are you sure it's a good idea to give me this? How… how will it look to your allies—you helping me like this?\"\n\nEido chittered. \"It will look like unity.\""

I have little compassion for the universe's mockery upon chivalric ideals.\n\nIn contrast, I call myself a creature of moral strength and sound reasoning, and as such, believe these traits allow me to judge so unforgivingly—but alas, I am also afflicted by a most curious and inquisitive nature. It is why, when my debased fellows departed to find unity with the Hive, I found myself compelled to witness their descent. \n\nNot to share in it, of course. I doubt we share anything more than a species and the dark urge we all undoubtedly feel.\n\nYet as I watched them, I could not deceive myself into denying the elegance of pouring the Light in all its multiplex glory into these avatars of terrible intricacy. It is a sinister geometry, but not without its beauty. Gazing on them with an eye unvarnished by niceties, one can see that a fiendish purity of purpose drives them. They spill confidence like a vintner drunk on his own reserves.\n\nSuch a shame that this purity and confidence was leveled at the unforgivable quintain striking at our great Traveler and unraveling its works.\n\nI shudder at the ease with which my comrades ignore such basic logic. This is the Hive! Disciples of that unholy church which laid our creator low. They struck for its heart and shattered a roaring conflagration into ten thousand motes flickering in the wind.

And in that moment, I think something… something good in me died.\n\nAnd Twenny-Two and Kemmasi and Marseille, they're all raising their partners—Hive Lightbearers, every last one. You'd think it'd be impossible, but sure enough, all standing there. Eee-Ie, Quasit, Hatcher—everyone's finding their purpose. There's Hive to the left of me, Hive to the right… I'm buried in 'em. And the whole time, every Ghost I ever knew is shouting, telling me, \"This is the Traveler's plan! Who are you to question it?\" \n\nAnd I thought… maybe they're right? I mean, I could see the Light scouring a whole world right in front of me. Maybe this was some kinda turning point for the Hive. Knowing your creator chose you to remake an entire species… oh, you'd make bad choices too.\n\nSo I shared my Light. Who wouldn't? A couple hundred of your closest friends bearing down on you, and a Hive Shredder waiting if you say no? I shared. I reached into him. Touched something deep. \n\nAnd what he offered back, it wasn't Light or Dark. It was cold. It was wrong. And I knew it would fill up whatever empty cracks in me the Light left behind. And… I chose to make it a part of me. To be half of his whole.\n\nI chose to share my soul with a monster.\n\nAnd the thing is… you can't just be part monster."

Yeah, so really, y'know, this is your fault, not mine!\n\nI know. I know you don't want to be dead. I know that! You think I don't know that?!\n\nI watched you shoot a Guardian. And her GHOST. Dead. All because I could hear you, in the back of my mind, needing me to bring you back. And I listened. I listened to the others… then to you… to everyone except myself. \n\nI didn't expect miracles, but… I expected something! \n\nYes, you're dead now. And I can hear you—but I can't. Don't you get it?

Was it pity? Optimism? \n\nMaybe… maybe it's just the obvious: I mean, Hive don't accept gifts; they take. Maybe the Traveler was tricked. The end of some long con. The Traveler isn't just some dumb orb ripe for grifting. Ghaul found that out the hard way.\n\nThere's gotta be more to it. I have to dig deeper. And if joining you damned me… well, hell sounds like a good place to start. I'll find out how she did it. And I don't care how much you try to change my mind: you're staying dead.

Arrived on scene. Victim is a Thrall. No identity. Cause of death: fractured neck due to blunt force trauma. Traces of Light detected. Nabenki interviewed the primary suspect; Hive prefer talking to their own and don't respond to things—even things that bring them back from the dead.\n\nOverheard confession. Suspect is Knight identified as Urukthalyn, victim's commander. Reported that when his Ghost detected Light within victim, Urukthalyn executed him for theft. Open and shut case.\n\nPLD018. 13:44. Three more deaths fitting same pattern: internal artifacts of Light, victims summarily executed. But circumstances raise more questions. Thralls don't partner with Ghosts; should be unable to receive or carry Light. \n\nNabenki tasked to investigate. Suspects an organized smuggling ring, potential Human or Fallen infiltration.\n\nPLD018. 14:57. Encountered suspect Thrall; no identification, classified POI-7. Tests confirm traces of Light. Nabenki applied standard Hive interrogation techniques, extracted confession after extended session. POI-7 admitted to \"stealing\" Light, keeping it in urns. Also implicated a superior Acolyte. Doesn't add up.\n\nPLD018. 19:12. Requested time alone with suspect to establish rapport. Nabenki hesitant; doesn't like being spoken to unbidden but acquiesces. POI-7 admitted to giving false confession to end \"visceral\" Hive interrogation. Claimed complete ignorance to the Light's origins in his system. When asked about unusual activity, reported that his symbiote feels sated without need for bloodshed or tithing.\n\nPLD018. 19:33. Consulted Nabenki for context regarding tithing. Apparently, Hive function on a system of energetic kickbacks, paid up the ladder, ending with queen. Would've been useful to know earlier. Suspect this network may be impacted by introduction of Light. Nabenki confirmed Light exhibits a \"negative pressure\" within the system. May be pushing trace amounts back through it.\n\nHave submitted theory to our commander for further investigation.\n\nPLD019. 06:30. Partner acknowledged me this morning, established eye contact. Potential illness?\n\nPLD019. 07:42. On my recommendation, POI-7 executed for perjury."

Loyal as you are, you still only see their actions, not the chains that drag them to inevitability. Just as Hive must test, Humans must control—and failing that, attack.

Jynx has no time to teach them about music. She needs to concentrate.\n\nHer Acolyte deserves to be perfect.\n\nShe pauses her melodic chiming and gives the stray phalanges one last nudge into place. No Ghost needs the entire corpse to bring their partner back, but this body—the body of HER partner—was a sacred canvas. It deserved all the love and consideration as the painting itself. And with every nudged phalange, the anticipation grew more beautiful!\n\nThe little Ghost looks at the body, dangling and impaled, its core grotesquely punctuated against one of the gothic spires the Hive so loved. She would've preferred to lay it prone; more ceremonial and appropriate for the sacred moment where life returned to dead flesh. Her Guardian deserves perfection, but fate places many limitations on a tiny, handless orb, and Jynx had long ago learned to make the best of disagreeable circumstance.\n\nShe scans the body once again. Everything in its place. \"Pygmalion's got nothing on me, babe!\" She taps her shell flap against the hollow cheek in what—she knows—will become their shared gesture of affection.\n\nJynx bobs back, and with only a moment's pause for butterflies in—well, she supposes not her stomach, but somewhere—her shell twists and splits into an orrery of wonder, bathing her Acolyte in Light. That lovingly placed finger moves first, twitching and clutching, and with a horrific noise that lies somewhere between suction and screaming, the former corpse pulls herself free of the spike through her chest.\n\n\"You're aliv—\"\n\nThe Acolyte lashes out ferociously with a twisted limb, knocking Jynx to the floor and condemning her with a gurgling shriek.

Safiyah raises her lantern and watches the trickle of survivors pass through the Iron Lords' gates. Some are wounded. Some lie on makeshift stretchers. She gestures to a tent, its interior glowing with warm firelight. \n \n\"They will freeze out here,\" she says. \"Take them inside, quickly.\"\n \nHer hospital, such as it is, is humbled by the stone structures which surround it. But she had overseen its construction when she first arrived… stocked it, served it. It was all she could do.\n \nThe gates close behind the Iron Lords. Unhurt, alive. Zavala is among them. She knows him: the one stubborn enough to argue, but not stubborn enough to ignore her. He speaks to his companions.\n \n\"—coordinated attacks by the House of Devils. If we take this opportunity to retaliate—\"\n \n\"Retaliate?!\"\n \nZavala turns to look at Safiyah. She stares him down.\n \n\"We have wounded here! We don't need violence. We need supplies!\"\n \nThe others break off, leave him to it—the same fight with the same woman.\n \n\"Excuse me?\" \n \nShe doesn't flinch.\n \n\"I was clear,\" she says.\n \nA drone—Ghost?—bobs in the air just behind Zavala's shoulder—Targe, his name is Targe.\n \n\"I'm not a part of this,\" Targe says. Safiyah stands on her toes and catches his eye before he ducks away.\n \n\"Moving against the Fallen will ensure your safety,\" Zavala says. \"Like I've told you before.\" \n \n\"You want to protect us?\" Safiyah points towards the meager hospital. \"This is how: by ensuring we have what we need to live.\"\n \n\"She isn't wrong,\" Targe says.\n \n\"Are you a part of this conversation or not?\" Zavala asks, glancing sharply at his Ghost. He turns back to Safiyah.\n \n\"You don't understand,\" she says, walking away.\n \n\"Where are you going?\" he asks. A silly question. She ducks under the tent flap. Zavala follows, strung along by their argument. He always wants the last word.\n \nSafiyah washes her hands in a basin, then glances at him. She will make him useful.\n \n\"Wash your hands,\" she tells him. He hesitates, but does so.\n \n\"Take this,\" she says, and hands him a fistful of clean rags. She moves to one of the cots, her head down as she inspects a fresh wound, still bleeding into the dirty bandage. She removes it carefully.\n \n\"Come here,\" she says and guides him to press the clean rags into the wound, staunching the flow of blood. He opens his mouth to speak again, but she raises her hand.\n \n\"I understand the situation,\" she says. \"Do you? Do you know how hard it is to survive in this world?\"\n \n\"Yes,\" he says. He eases the pressure—she points, snaps her fingers, and he presses down again.\n \n\"Without your Ghost?\"\n \nHe says nothing. That one will need sutures, Safiyah thinks to herself. She calculates their dwindling stores as she fetches antiseptic and gloves.\n \n\"It's not just Fallen. It's not just Warlords. It's sickness. Starvation. Cold.\"\n \nShe motions for Zavala to stand aside, and he does. The wounded man, regrettably awake, shivers, stiffens, bites down on a scream as she cleans his wound as gently as she can.\n \n\"We don't walk away from these things the way you do.\"\n \nThere is a note of pity in her words. She thinks that he will argue with her, push back, raise his voice. But he says nothing—he is pensive, quiet. She looks up and sees the way his eyes shift, how his jaw stiffens. He wants to speak.\n \nShe turns away from him, pulling off her gloves at the wrist. Another patient, a woman with a dressed wound across her temple, had shifted in her sleep, her blanket fallen to one side. Carefully, Safiyah picks up the blanket's edge and pulls it up so that it covers her again. She passes a hand over the woman's brow, feeling for fever, and finds none. Safiyah smiles. When she looks up, she sees Zavala watching her.\n \n\"The wounded look to me.\" She does not lower her eyes, does not bow her head. \"Not you.\""

        "text": "Safiyah knits by the remainder of the afternoon light, seated outside her tent. It is early spring, her fingers red from the cold, her breath misting in the air. Zavala leads training exercises in the courtyard, sparring with civilians. Some stand awkwardly, holding weapons too heavy for them to wield. Others move with more confidence. Safiyah's eyes drop to her needles.\n \nThen she hears a cry of pain. Blood runs down a civilian's shoulder, staining his front. Safiyah can see the wound from her seat. Rising, she takes quick steps toward them, her knitting forgotten.\n \n\"Do you think your enemy would stop at one wound?\" Zavala's voice is a sharp bark. The other man picks up his blade again, despite his shoulder. Safiyah approaches and snaps her fingers.\n \n\"What are you doing?\"\n \nZavala turns to her. Here, an opportunity: Zavala's sparring partner jumps forward, catching him by surprise. The blade slices Zavala's forearm, skin opening in a spray of bright blood.\n \nThe others gawk, as if they hadn't expected a Risen to bleed. Targe rises up, ready to heal the wound. She raises a hand to stop him.\n \n\"Don't,\" she says. The Ghost bobs in the air, looks at her, looks at Zavala.\n \n\"What do you want?\" Zavala barks. He pinches his forearm closed, but the blood runs hot and steaming over his fingers.\n \nSafiyah ignores Zavala's retort and gestures to his sparring partner. \"Come with me,\" she says.\n \n\"Targe,\" Zavala says to his Ghost, but Safiyah snaps her fingers again.\n \n\"You too. I want to teach you something. Come inside.\" \n \nShe walks into the hospital tent, knowing she will be obeyed.\n \nHe obeys. \n \nOnce inside, Safiyah inspects Zavala's wound. It is nothing serious, but deep enough for her attention. Her assistant sees to the sparring partner, who looks away sheepishly when Zavala glances at him.\n \n\"What are you doing?\" he asks her.\n \n\"I think that's obvious,\" she says. Zavala and his Ghost observe in silence as she cleans the wound.\n \n\"This isn't necessary,\" he says, but lets her continue. She produces her hooked needle, the hemostat, the polypropylene thread. Tools that fit easily in her hands; precious resources for an immortal man.\n \n\"I'm going to close the wound,\" she says, and touches his arm lightly with a gloved hand. \"I will make six sutures. It will take four days, maybe five, to heal.\"\n\nHis features soften. Perhaps he sees that her mind is set. He looks away in a sheepish expression.\n\n\"I will make sure your supplies are replenished,\" he says. \"Simply tell me what you need.\" \n\nSafiyah feels a flutter of surprise at this promise. Now she will answer his first question.\n \n\"You need to know what it's like for us,\" she tells him. She waits for consent; he nods. She pierces the wound and draws its edges together. He doesn't wince.\n \n\"Where did you learn this?\"\n \nGenuine curiosity. The first suture.\n \n\"My mother,\" she answers. \"And books from the Golden Age.\"\n\nShe gestures to a ramshackle shelf holding a dozen books. Old, crumbling, but cared for.\n \n\"I'd like to see them,\" he says. She smiles, pleased. Second suture.\n \n\"I'll show them to you,\" she says. When she raises her eyes, she sees that he is looking at her with an intensity she can't place. Despite herself, she feels a warmth creep into her skin.\n \n\"We traveled,\" she says, too quickly, her eyes dropping back to the third suture. \"Very far. Village to village. My mother, father, sister, and me.\" Fourth suture. \"Father killed in a raid. Mother died from disease. Sister a way's west of here. But I kept to my travels.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asks, softly.\n \nShe passes the needle through its fifth suture.\n \n\"There are always more people to help. I will move on once I finish training him.\" She nods to her assistant.\n \nSafiyah brings her shears to the thread of the last suture. The wound is closed. She winds a taut bandage around his arm.\n \n\"Where will you go?\" he asks after a stiff silence. Safiyah realizes she doesn't know how to answer. Her thoughts don't stretch beyond this moment. She tucks the bandage beneath itself.\n \n\"Finished.\"\n \nHe flexes, winces, stills. She smiles.\n \n\"True healing takes time.\"\n \n***\n \nThat night, she hears voices in the empty courtyard: Zavala and Saladin, standing by a brazier, talking in low tones. She peers from the flap in the tent to watch, to listen.\n \n\"She is a skilled and formidable woman,\" Zavala says.\n \nSaladin stands with his chin raised in near disdain. Zavala is a silhouette in the firelight. \n \n\"I'm not stupid,\" Saladin growls. \"I see the way you look at each other.\"\n \nSafiyah's breath catches. She almost doesn't hear his next words over the sound of her heart.\n \n\"I have nothing but respect for her,\" Zavala says curtly. Saladin rolls his eyes. Both men stare each other down for a long moment.\n \n\"We live in different worlds,\" Saladin's voice softens. \"You can try to abandon ours, but theirs will reject you.\"\n \n\"I don't believe that,\" Zavala says.\n \n\"Believe what you want. But whatever life you make with her will be too fragile for you to hold onto.\"\n \nSaladin puts a hand on Zavala's shoulder. Safiyah could almost mistake it for compassion.\n \n\"It will break,\" he says, his voice low. \"And you'll both be hurt.\"\n\nSafiyah lets the tent flap fall. She does not see if they hear it."

He holds the needles too tightly, and she gently places a hand over his knuckles until she feels him relax his grip.\n\nThey sit together outside her hospital. Safiyah teaches him to knit under the late spring sun.\n\n\"This is complicated,\" he says.\n\n\"Only when you aren't paying attention,\" she tells him. Their eyes briefly meet. She looks away, smiling, at the afternoon sky.\n\n\"Look,\" she says in a tight breath. Smoke plumes on the horizon. They both jolt upright, Zavala awkwardly untangling his fingers from the yarn.\n\nThe smoke muddies the sky. Fallen, or Warlords. They have found new victims. Safiyah looks at the growing grim resolve on Zavala's face, then makes for the hospital tent to gather her kit.\n\nA siren blares over the encampment as Safiyah emerges. She makes for the gates as the Iron Lords ready themselves; Zavala takes her by the arm.\n \n\"You can't be serious,\" he says. His expression hardens when he sees that she is.\n \n\"People are in danger,\" she says.\n \n\"It's not safe.\"\n \n\"That is why I have to go.\"\n \n\"At least wait until we've secured the area.\"\n \nSafiyah pulls her arm from his grip. She leaves through the gates before he can argue.\n \nThe Fallen have ambushed a caravan. Safiyah races through black smoke belching from an overturned sledge, the wreckage crushing the spring flowers. Safiyah rushes to a woman cowering behind a wagon, blood seeping from a wound at her temple. A man lies on the ground behind her, clutching at his stomach, his spilled entrails. A Dreg lunges for them; Safiyah drives a knife into its neck.\n \nZavala leads the main charge to the caravan. The Fallen, screeching at each other, turn their attention to their attackers as bursts of Solar energy roar through the air.\n \nZavala rushes to Safiyah's side, putting himself between her and a charging Captain, its Arc spear raised, and it pierces Zavala through the chest. He coughs blood, falls to the ground, goes still. Safiyah screams, horrified at the sight. But she scrambles for Zavala's weapon and raises it just as the Captain bears down on her. \n \nShe fires three rounds through its chest and throat. She sputters as the Ether tears from its body. The corpse lands heavily on her; she pushes it away.\n \nTarge sweeps his fallen Guardian, and with a hard breath, Zavala rises again. The sight of him startles her—a man come back to life. He gets his bearings, sees the Captain dead on the ground. \n \n\"Are you all right?\"\n \n\"Yes,\" she says, her voice trembling. Safiyah turns back to the unlucky man who will not rise again, and the woman who weeps at his side.\n \nIt's in the quiet of the aftermath that Safiyah hears an infant's cry. She jumps to her feet, searching for it in the wreckage, and finds a dead man curled around a squirming bundle. She turns him by his shoulder; the corpse holds the infant so tenderly and tightly that Safiyah has to break his fingers to take the boy from his embrace. She brings the child to her chest, holding his head delicately, and the boy's cries turn into whispered gurgles.\n \nSafiyah begins to cry. For the child in her arms, the dead man who held him, the scent of blood and Ether. For those whom she could not save. Her tears are soft, and she shivers. She feels Zavala's palm touch her shoulder and move down her back in silent comfort. She heaves a sigh, then straightens and looks to him.\n \n\"We'll keep him safe,\" Zavala says, and she nods.\n \nThey return with the child. Safiyah feeds him, bathes him. Zavala smiles, holding the child in his arms. The boy reaches for him with tiny hands and looks up at him with wide, brown eyes.\n \n\"The boy needs a name,\" she says. She thinks for a moment, remembers her father with fondness.\n \n\"Hakim,\" she declares, and it is so.\n \n***\n \nHakim grows. Months pass until summer comes and the cicadas sing. Zavala visits Safiyah between his duties, and Safiyah soothes Hakim's cries when Zavala is absent. Resources are thin. They do their best.\n \nIn the evenings, Safiyah holds Hakim's warmth to her chest. She feels the rise and fall of his breath. Bowing, she presses her lips to the curls on the crown of his head. Zavala is beside her, a hand at the small of her back.\n \nThe cicadas sing—she gestures for Zavala to listen. The cicadas sing.\n\n\"The ancient Greeks thought that these insects lived forever,\" she says. \"Reborn each time they came from the earth.\"\n \n Zavala puts his arms around them both.\n \n\"They spend 17 years underground. They almost went extinct. Then the Collapse… and now they thrive again.\"\n\nShe coos at Hakim for a moment.\n\n\"I will take him to my sister's village,\" she says. Zavala's features soften.\n \n\"We will take him,\" he answers, and she smiles. This is how he tells her.\n \nZavala speaks to Saladin the following morning. When Zavala finds her again, he has left behind the pendant with the Iron Lords' sigil."

She simply raises an eyebrow.\n \nDays pass. \n \n\"I don't think she likes me.\" Zavala speaks softly over Hakim sleeping in the makeshift cradle in Amani's home.\n \n\"She definitely doesn't like me,\" Targe says, emerging.\n \n\"Why do you say that?\" Safiyah asks.\n \n\"She said, 'I don't like you,' \" Targe answers. \"To both of us.\" \n \nSafiyah frowns. \"She likes Hakim,\" she offers.

Through the window, she sees Zavala and their son spar with wooden swords in the field behind their home. It is play. Their son is nine. Safiyah can hear the clack of wood on wood in the autumn air. Her eyes drop back to her yarn.\n \nClack, clack.\n \nTheir son is twelve. She sees Zavala correct Hakim's stance, raise his arms, straighten his back. The boy only comes up to his father's elbows. Targe circles around them. The yarn shifts around her fingers as she passes it from needle to needle.\n \nClack, clack.\n \nTheir son is fifteen. The sleeve of the sweater she works on lengthens. It is summer, but she knits for the colder months ahead. Her sister sits beside her, cleaning a rifle and counting bullets.\n \n\"We're overdue for a raid,\" Amani says, as if she were remarking on a low crop yield, bad weather, or a stillborn calf—just another hardship, inevitable. Bullets clink together in her lap. \n \nSafiyah spreads the woolen sweater over her knees. \n \n\"For Hakim?\" Amani asks. Safiyah nods.\n \n\"He outgrows them every two months. He needs new trousers too. I can see his ankles.\"\n \nThe final clack of the swords clatters out, and she looks up.\n \nSafiyah sees the flash of a metal blade in Hakim's hand. She throws down her knitting and runs to them. The knife is at Zavala's throat when she reaches them.\n \n\"What are you doing!\" \n \nIt is not a question. It is an admonition. Zavala steps back and gestures to the knife in Hakim's hands.\n \n\"I'm teaching him how to defend himself.\" \n \nSafiyah reaches for her son, holds Hakim to her chest. She kisses the crown of his head, whispers softly into the curls of his hair. But he pushes her away, steps back, stares up at her defiantly.\n \n\"I can do it,\" he says. \"It's just a lesson!\"\n \nSafiyah looks to Zavala, shaking her head in disbelief. \n \n\"He needs to be prepared to take a life.\" He speaks gently, as if he had not just asked his son to slit his throat.\n \n\"He is a child,\" she says.\n \nHakim takes a breath, frowns, begins to speak. Zavala touches his shoulder.\n \n\"Do you think that matters to the Fallen?\" His voice is dark.\n \nSafiyah takes the knife from her son's hand and holds it by the flat of the blade. An edge for harming, not healing. \n\nShe knows Zavala is right, and hates it. \n\n***\n \nThat night, Safiyah's sister stays up with her, talking by candlelight.\n \n\"It's been years.\" Amani clicks her tongue. \"He'll never see the way we do. They can't.\"\n \n\"I don't believe that.\"\n\n\"I know you don't.\"\n \nAmani laughs, but Safiyah is silent, frowning. He must understand. \n\nHer sister sighs.\n \n\"He loves you.\"\n \nSafiyah nods. \n \n\"He loves Hakim.\"\n \nShe nods again.\n \n\"Then maybe that is enough.\"\n\nWhen she returns home, Safiyah finds Zavala watching over Hakim as he sleeps. Zavala rises, pulls the blanket a little higher over Hakim's shoulder, then brushes his fingers over his son's cheek.\n\nSafiyah realizes then that in all the Risen's long, unenviable years, they were never once children.\n \nShe reaches for Zavala, and he takes her into his arms, a silent question of forgiveness.\n \n\"Let him be a child for a little longer,\" she whispers into his ear. \"You will miss these days when they have gone.\""

The House of Devils. Zavala is through the door before Safiyah can speak. She gathers her kit.\n \nThe gunfire grows louder, quicker. There are cries of pain, of death throes.\n \nHakim is seventeen.\n \n\"Stay here,\" she pleads. \"Stay safe.\"\n \n\"I can fight,\" he tells her. He is taller than she is now.\n \n\"Please,\" she says. Reluctantly, Hakim nods. Safiyah puts her arms around him, holds him for a moment, tries to quell her fear, and then follows her husband into the fight.\n \nFallen clamber over the village's gates, disorganized and led by a Captain too vicious and too eager to be where the fighting is thickest. The friends and neighbors Zavala trained raise their weapons and hold their ground as they are swarmed. Safiyah sees her husband leading the defense, shouting commands over gunfire and screams.\n \nA farmhand with a gun falls when a bullet pierces his thigh; Safiyah is there to drag him from danger, tourniquet and dressings in hand. She keeps low, time and again reaching the wounded as the Fallen are pushed back.\n \nShe hears a voice—instantly familiar, now threaded with terror, piercing through the fray. Safiyah turns and sees Hakim deflect a swipe of the Arc spear from the Fallen Captain. The blow unsteadies him. Safiyah screams his name. Hakim steps back, his eyes wide.\n \nThe Captain draws the spear and jams the weapon into her son's body. \n \nZavala is suddenly there, knocks the creature down with two shots, finishes it with another. Safiyah runs to Hakim and skids to her knees beside him. \n \nSlick redness coats the back of her hands as she presses hard on the wound, edges singed by Arc energy. Blood wells from Hakim's mouth as he tries to speak. His grip loosens on his weapon—a sickle, a tool to cut down stalks of rye—and his eyes go slack.\n \nThe scent of her son's death settles into the pith of her lungs. \n \nShe does not hear Zavala's footsteps. She does not hear anything. Her bloodied palm is at her son's cheek, wiping away the cold tears that had stayed behind on his unfocused eyes.\n \nHer breath falters. Slowly, she draws her other hand from Hakim's wound and puts her arms around him. She feels her son's body against her chest, the weight in her arms. She remembers, briefly, when he had finally grown so heavy that she could no longer cradle him as she once had.\n \n\"Safi,\" she hears, at last. \n\nShe turns to look at Zavala. He stands as a silhouette against the rising sun, the new dents and cracks of his armor shimmering in the light. He comes toward her, his face horror. She wonders if he had died as well. She turns to look at Hakim again. There is no Ghost for her son.\n \nZavala kneels beside her. Shaking, he takes Hakim's body into his arms, and they bring him home."

Safiyah pulls his blanket up, trembling, stopping short of drawing it over his face.\n \nWhen she reaches for her husband's hand beside her, she realizes she is stained up to her elbows with her son's dark, blackened blood. The blood of a deep, interior wound.\n \nZavala reaches for the edge of his son's blanket, adjusting it to cover Hakim's shoulder, carefully, as if he is afraid to wake him.\n \n***\n \n\"What will you do now?\"\n \nAmani has a way of cutting to the heart of things. Hakim has been buried for a month. Flowers on his headstone. The sisters sit, overlooking the graveyard. The night air is thick with summer warmth. All is silvered in the moonlight. The cicadas sing. The world does not stop and witness her grief.\n \nSafiyah shakes her head, silent. Her sister puts an arm around her shoulders.\n \n\"You will have to decide.\"\n \nThe silence grows heavy. She feels Amani draw her into an embrace.\n \n\"He was a good boy,\" her sister says, and Safiyah hears the quaver in her voice. \"Stubborn and brave, like his father.\"\n \nThey part, and Amani clasps Safiyah's hands in hers. Her sister gives a sad smile; Safiyah does not return it. Her grief is solitary. Inward. She cries when she is alone.\n \n\"Zavala is at Hakim's grave most nights,\" Safiyah says at last.\n \nBut not tonight.\n \n\"Sleep,\" her sister says. \"Sleep, and think about your future. Here, or elsewhere.\"\n \n\"You want me to leave?\" Safiyah asks. Amani shakes her head, squeezes her sister's hands.\n \n\"No. Never. But I want you to find your joy again. I don't believe you'll find it here.\"\n \n \n***\n \n\"Bring him back.\"\n \nSafiyah hears Zavala's voice when she returns home. She follows the sound to their bedroom.\n \n\"Bring him back,\" he demands again. There is a tremor in Zavala's voice. Safiyah peers through the slip of space offered by the unlatched door. Her husband faces away from her, speaking to his Ghost.\n \n\"I can't,\" Targe says.\n \nTarge stares up at Zavala. She can see the Ghost shivering.\n \n\"Take my Light and bring him back.\" He struggles at every word.\n \n\"You know I can't.\"\n \n\"Would you?\" Zavala asks, something clawing into his voice. \"Would you bring him back, if you could?\"\n \nIf Targe speaks, Safiyah doesn't hear it. But she hears the scrape of Zavala's gun on the nightstand.\n \n\"Find a way. Bring him back,\" Zavala pleads.\n \nSafiyah doesn't hesitate when she sees Zavala raise the weapon. She swings open the door. Her husband flinches, turns, sees her standing at the threshold. Careful, she walks to him, puts a hand on his arm, lowers his gun. Zavala falls to his knees, the gun clattering to the floor.\n \nSafiyah reaches for Targe, and he floats to her. She holds him in her hands. There is a thrum, a warmth, in her palms. The Ghost's singular eye, pale blue, looks up at her. She remembers all the times he hovered just out of Hakim's reach, teasing him, playing with him. In that moment, she knows that Targe loved him too.\n \n\"We cannot change what happened,\" she whispers to her husband. \"This will not change who we are.\"\n \nShe thinks he will turn to her and ask, Who am I? But he doesn't. Targe leaves her embrace to hover beside Zavala.\n\n\"I can't stay here,\" she says. He says nothing. He knows himself—and he knows who she is too. She is certain.\n\nSafiyah searches his face. She sees Hakim when she looks at him. She sees her own pain, reflected in his eyes. And she sees his pain as well, just as endless as the years he will suffer beyond her own. Safiyah looks away.\n \n\"I can't understand eternity,\" she says, sadly. \"I don't know if you can either. But you will live it. I will not.\"\n \nZavala takes a hard breath, and the sob drags itself from his body. She looks at him again.\n\n\"Don't forget us, Zavala.\" Her voice breaks. \"For all your years. Please.\"\n \n\"Never.\""

To Zavala, Amani gave only a nod and a sad smile.\n \nSoon, the stone structures of the Iron Lord encampment rise on the horizon. \n \nZavala and Safiyah pass where they first found Hakim. The bodies are gone, the blood long soaked into the earth. The burned trees have new growth around their wounds. But the fragments of rusted wreckage along their path, picked over for any useful pieces, are still half-buried in the soil.\n \nAt the gates, Safiyah presses her knitting needles into his hands. \n \n\"To keep you warm,\" she says. He nods his head and thanks her, his voice small.\n \n\"You will survive this,\" she tells him. She knows he has no choice.\n \nSafiyah departs to find the people who need her. She feels Zavala's gaze cling to her until the gates of the Iron Lords disappear into the horizon.\n \n***\n \nThe gates of the encampment open for Zavala, alone. Saladin says little, passes no judgment, tenders no admonition. All he says to him is this:\n \n\"Love is a moment in time. We are not.\"\n \nZavala wonders, for an instant, if Saladin speaks from experience. He does not ask but simply takes a breath and follows Lord Saladin.\n \n***\n \nIt is decades until a message arrives from Amani—half crumpled and discolored from the uncertain journey it took to reach him in the Last City. \"Come quickly,\" it reads. \"Before it is too late.\"\n \nBut he arrives too late. \n \nAmani stands at the grave among the mourners, stooped, old. He nods to her, catching her eyes for a moment. A sad, familiar smile crosses her lips again before she returns the gesture in silent thanks.\n \nHe waits until most have left before he approaches the headstone. He holds a flower, picked on his journey. It was fresh when he found it, but its petals are bruised now as he gently places it on the churned earth of her grave.\n \nZavala rises and sees a woman standing beside him. They have the same eyes, warm and kind. Her daughter.\n \n\"How did you know her?\" she asks. His breath catches, unsure of how to answer a simple question from one mourner to another.\n \n\"I'm an old friend,\" he says, unable to keep the weariness from seeping into his words. The woman looks at him askance; he wonders, briefly, if she knows of him, his history. Her brother. But she simply nods and thanks him, and nothing more is said.\n \nYears later, he visits the woman's grave. Then her son's. Her son's son. The graveyard grows thick with headstones. He makes the journey each time.\n \nThey do not come to the Last City for 10 generations. The Hidden tell him when they are born, when they are sick, and when they die. He never speaks to them when they are alive, but at each grave, he leaves a token and a question: Can you forgive me?\n \nThe Red War does not claim them, but when the City grieves for those lost to the Vex and the Endless Night, Zavala grieves for the last of Safiyah's descendants. This time, there is no body for a grave.\n \nNow, Zavala sits at his desk. The knitting needles are worn with use. He holds them carefully, remembering how she had placed his fingers so that he could follow her movements. \n\nHe casts on a length of yarn and begins again."

In this way, the Awoken were the first to know of the Great Navigator: his philosophies, his strategies, his weaknesses. And as the coven contemplated the possibilities laid wide before this god-king's far-flung sword, it was decreed that they would build a throne world beneath an energy well as blind as the ferryman Charon.\n\nNascia drew the schematics. Portia worked out the calculations. They made their first test with a small rift generator on the eastern shore. Satisfied that their methods were sound, they then went to a grand cathedral to dig the well. There, Lissyl and Sedia augured the first borehole with the help of Riven, who had taken the shape of a needle-nosed basilisk, while Kalli and Shuro Chi constructed the gate itself, deep below, in a hall they named \"The Confluence.\"\n\nIllyn made tincture after tincture of queensfoil until her clothes stank and her hands were stained reddish-black. Open-eyed, she walked between planes and sorted the threads of reality on a vast metaphysical loom, weaving some closer, some more distant.\n\nMara and Riven shaped her third throne together, and the artistry of their work was a testament to the hungry joy they felt in that partnership. They named it Eleusinia, and it was in those Ascendant halls that Mara finally carved a statue for Sjur.\n\nWhen it came time to connect the Well to the unreality that lay beyond the gateway, Sedia asked, \"Would it not be wiser to leave this door without a key?\" Riven, now an immense antlered serpent with broad tiger paws, tightened around the perimeter of the room like a noose.\n\n\"Egg,\" Mara corrected absently, chewing on her thumbnail.\n\n\"The key is so heavy as to be unliftable,\" Kalli ventured, since they were speaking metaphorically.\n\nSedia flapped her hand dismissively. \"Yes, yes, I know.\" They all knew that the gate required a continuous multi-week charge of paracausal energies, and that almost nothing in this solar system could produce such energies at the scale required by the gateway. Almost. \"It's just— do we…\"\n\n\"Do we wish to trust the Guardians?\" Illyn filled in dryly.\n\nMara ran her hand along the sleek surface of the primary well's control mechanism, then turned and walked alone toward the fresh, foggy air that blew in from the coast. The Techeuns watched her go.\n\n\"There is only the plan,\" Illyn said. \"Remember your vows, Sedia.\""

Who are you?\"\n\nThe answer came at once, ++WRONG! IT IS THE EKPYROSIC. WE ARE THE NOTHING-SPACE FABRIC.++\n\nHearing this, Mara recognized a riddle. She turned at once and left the Queenswalk so that Riven would not be inspired. As she walked, she thought. At length she said, \"Wrong. You are the Ancients. You are the idea that gives fate its shape.\"\n\nThat one-voice came again, as clear and strong as the birth of the universe, booming with dispassionate curiosity, ++IT THINKS ITSELF WISE! HOW DID SOMETHING LIKE IT ATTAIN SUCH REVELATION?++\n\nMara lengthened her stride, taking the steps three at a time so that she could duck into a little-used transport gate. She emerged in a small coastal observatory—then nothing more than a grand dormitory—and found Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, hovering four feet off the ground. Blood poured from her ears and nostrils. Her eyes saw nothing. The other Techeuns were transfixed thusly in a geometric array around the Dreaming City—each one inert, suspended, bleeding.\n\nMastering her horror, Mara said, \"I have lived alongside you.\" And because she was afraid for Kelda, she asked, \"Do you intend violence?\"\n\nAt once, the Techeuns collapsed to the ground like marionettes from severed strings—all but Kelda Wadj, whose augment blazed with coruscating light. She rose higher into the air and began to unravel, particle by particle. As she came undone, she said, ++NOW IT INSULTS US.++ \n\nMara steeled herself against the horrific sight of her old friend's ruin. She had been a fool to think the riddling was over. She said, \"Of course.\" Violence, after all, is a matter of perspective. \"What I mean is, what would you ask me?\"\n\nBeloved, wise Kelda Wadj burst apart and then collapsed all at once into a singularity that burned and burned and burned but destroyed nothing around it. From her un-throat came the voice again, which Mara felt in the atomic marrow of her bones, and it said, ++WHAT WOULD IT ASK US?++\n\nFor fifteen days and fifteen nights, the singularity burned unshielded.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, they began construction of the Oracle Engine, which took the singularity of the Allteacher as its seed-heart."

There is a cliff behind him and lush gardens ahead. His jailer would not grant him the honor of a quick death, so she must intend to torture him. She thinks he will yield like the flesh-lovers from House Judgment. She is wrong. Whatever indignities she can muster are nothing compared to what he deserves.\n\nWith his chin held high, he imagines shucking off his armor and laying all four of his arms in his Captain's hands. His Captain is his mother, and she will not dock him with a scythe. She will twist and tear his arms from his body like she is shucking a fine, fat crab for dinner, and he will be glad of the slow, sick cracks and crunches of his bones. He will be glad of the shame. Let him go limbless for the rest of his wasted life. Let the Ether-thirst shrivel him up like a yaviirsi fig.\n\n\"What do you think?\" his jailer asks in a language he cannot understand. She steps up beside him and claps a hand on his shoulder. He flinches. She is nearly as tall as he is, and for a creature with no claws, her grip is strong and sure.\n\nTogether, they contemplate the gardens.\n\n\"It's all a bit much for my taste,\" she admits as he sneaks a furtive look at her.\n\nHer bow is unstrung. There is only one arrow in her quiver.\n\nShe is stupid.\n\nHe whirls, trips her, and sprints for the cliff. She swears, recovers, and lunges after him. As he pitches himself off the edge, he thinks of his mother's shame and prays that she forgets him. Better that she never had a son than a weakling so easily captured by the enemy.\n\nIt is his bad luck that she catches his foot with one hand. His helmet slams into the rocky cliffside. A piece of his rebreather cracks off and disappears into the mist far below. He flails, but he cannot drag her down with him; somehow, she hauls him in like a fish. As soon as she has him on solid ground, she binds his ankles with the string of her bow. \"All right,\" she says, catching her breath. \"All right.\" She chuckles, pats his shoulder fondly, and then pulls him upright like a sack of psakiks.\n\nShe takes a step back, brushing off her hands against the seat of her trousers. He glowers, the surliest psakiks sack this side of the Great Machine, hating her horrible, squared-off teeth and her blunt, stubby fingers. \"Let's try this again, shall we?\"\n\nDrawing two fractal knives from sheaths on her thighs, she makes a perfect ireliis bow before him. Thunderstruck, he sits up straight. Stares.\n\n\"Not good?\" she asks, and tries again.\n\nFurious confusion takes him. This is some kind of trick. Blasphemous mockery. \"Iirsoveks,\" he rumbles.\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Nama.\" Sheathing one of her knives, she holds out her free hand with her fingers spread in supplication.\n\nHe draws his chin toward his throat with this fresh betrayal, narrowing his secondary eyes. It speaks!\n\nSlowly, without breaking eye contact, she lays her other knife on the ground between them. The blade points toward her boots. He watches her every movement. How many secrets have the flesh-lovers betrayed, that this creature can make peace like a cringing drekh before his kel?\n\nShe taps two fingers against her cuirass. \"Sjur,\" she says slowly, then she points at him.\n\nHonor-bound even as he simmers in scandal, he replies, \"Misraaks. Velask, Si-yu-riks.\"\n\n\"Mithrax,\" she repeats, then grins. \"Velask, Mithrax. And welcome! Let's have a look about, shall we?\""

Those who came arrived in the Gardens of Esila, and Azirim was the very last. Seeing him land, Esila said to him, \"Ah! You are bold. Do you truly think you've earned the right to revel in this place?\"\n\nAnd Azirim answering said, \"Please, wise lady. I've gone 'round the worlds and through the stars themselves. I have come only to congratulate your people. If you lend me your ear, I can prove I will not waste the mercy you might grant me.\"\n\nAnd Esila said to him, \"We've often lent our ear to your indiscretions. I know what happens to that which is lent to you. I need no assurance.\"\n\nAnd Azirim answering said, \"My indiscretions? Wise lady, I do admit, I may have whispered truths you gave me to deceive those who would deceive me. But have I ever struck out with hungry fang against your people? Have I set fire to your trust? I have seen the error of my ways. Let me prove to you oh how I have changed.\"\n\nAnd Esila, though she could see a flickering in Azirim's reflection, could not resist a redemption story. Esila cast forth her hand and beckoned to Azirim in mercy. And Esila said to him, \"Join us and be glad, but let me hear your testimony first.\"\n\nAnd so invited, Azirim bowed his crested head and hid a secret smile and spoke with the pardon Esila had given him. He recounted his many regrets in deceiving the kind merchants in the capital city of Interamnia. He recounted his charity to the wayfaring Corsairs who could not have escaped the heliopause without his aid. He recounted his journey to retrieve the eutech stolen from Pallas by the profane scavengers the Fallen, and he named his friends and those who had shown him kindness. And from the raucous parties beyond the lush gardens of Esila came an audience of Techeuns in training and flush-cheeked young Corsairs. They knelt in the dewy grass and they listened, and as they listened, and as Azirim spoke, his appetite grew and grew. Night fell on the Dreaming City.\n\nAnd Azirim said to those who knelt enraptured, \"Come, let me sing to you of extinction. Let me sing to you of lives lost in beautiful places, o audience mine. Sing with me, sing!\" He bade them rise, and led them singing down and away from the gardens of Esila. He spread his wings and flew out into the empty air beyond the steep cliffs that bordered the gardens. And to those who happened to glance toward the gardens from far-off pavilions, it seemed a merry parade, a joyous chorus.\n\nAnd they did not hear the singing stop.\n\nAnd they did not hear the bodies dashed against the shore below.\n\nAnd they did not see Azirim grow, or laugh, or flee."

As the elevator descends, she looks left at Illyn and then right at Uldren. She shuffles in her gleaming formal armor. From exile as Tower emissary to THIS is incredible. Unbelievable. She does not deserve it. \"This is real,\" she whispers, unable to stop herself. Uldren smiles, but Illyn makes a warding gesture: Be silent!\n\nMusic begins to swell as the elevator settles. At the center of the room, the Paladins and the rest of Illyn's Techeuns are arrayed around Riven, of course, and—\n\nHer breath catches. \n\nMara. \n\nShe can't help shooting another quick glance at Uldren: How..?\n\nHis smile widens.\n\nPetra sets her jaw, pulls her shoulders back, stands strong and tall.\n\nA chorus of thirty sings them into the Hall of Names. The air is sweet with lavender, and there are hundreds of candles lit all around the room, and even at this distance she can see Hallam is verklempt. This is as good a homecoming as she could ever imagine. More than she ever deserved.\n\nWhen they reach the dais, she kneels. Uldren and Illyn proceed past her so that they can acknowledge the Queen and her waiting counselors. The song ends; the music quells. Uldren and Illyn speak together, and their voices ring out fierce and true. \"Your Grace, we here present to you Petra Venj, your loyal servant, wherefore all you who are come this day to witness her homage and service. Do you acknowledge her?\"\n\nPetra cannot see anything but her own distorted reflection in her polished sabatons. She closes her eyes.\n\n\"I do,\" Mara says, and Petra's throat tightens.\n\nUldren and Illyn turn, synchronized. \"Petra Venj! Are you willing to take the oath?\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" Petra manages, struggling to steady her voice.\n\n\"Will you solemnly promise and swear to protect our people, our holdings, our territories, and our immaterial interests?\"\n\n\"I solemnly promise so to do.\"\n\n\"Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Will you, to the utmost of your power, uphold your sospital duties in defense of your Queen's life? Will you execute and preserve inviolably the orders of your Queen? And will you preserve unto your dying breath the secrets committed to your charge?\"\n\n\"All this I promise to do.\"\n\n\"Then rise,\" Mara says, \"and declare yourself.\"\n\nPetra lifts her head to find Mara's eyes. \"Let it be declared that the oaths which I have here before promised, I, Petra Venj, will perform and keep.\"\n\nMara smiles and steps forward with a fresh-forged knife. \"Then receive this blade, brought now from the forges of Interamnia. With this blade, do justice, stop the growth of inequity, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform the things that are amiss, and confirm the things that are in proper order: that doing these things you may embody my will and become my Wrath. May the hunt be good.\"\n\n\"May the hunt be good,\" echoes the assembly.\n\nPetra does not see the cynical glance that passes between Leona and Pavel, who have both served the Queen faithfully for decades. She does not see the way Riven tastes the air. She sees Mara, and Mara alone."

She wets the pad of her thumb with the tip of her tongue, then uses the moisture to hold a bundle of fresh-picked asphodelia in place. She ties off the stems with a length of silk-spun gold thread, then begins the mindless busywork of braiding in all the expected accoutrements: a serrated fang, a shotgun shell, a cloudy amethyst crystal…\n\nRiven turns to watch. On this day, her head is the size of a Fallen pike. She is vibrant blue with a yellow and red crest, and her pupils are crescents within her lidless eyes. After a time, she says, \"Madadh is dead but you make him no bouquet.\" \n\nMara looks up, struck by the novelty of the moment. She studies Riven, and swallows the first words that come to her tongue, which are, Madadh's bones are whispering at this very moment on Venus. Instead, she asks, \"You mourn him?\"\n\nThat crescent-pupil contracts as thin as a sickle's edge. \"No.\"\n\nHaving found the true answer, Mara resumes her work. A while passes in silence until she says, \"Ahamkara have no traditions.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No sentiment.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMara bites off a piece of thread. \"Why did you allow my brother to spirit you away?\"\n\n\"You know this truth, wise Queen. He is so full of succulence.\"\n\n\"Mm. And why do you roost here when there is rich hunting beyond my Reef?\"\n\n\"Truly I say to you\"—here Mara hides a small smile—\"the Awoken have entrusted What-Will-Be to you their Queen, and thus they are all dry as a stone to me. Pleasantly so, for wetness is sweet feed, but dry stone is a friendly basking-place. You, you are as hot and flat as the plateaus of Mercury, and your heat stirs my blood to move.\"\n\nMara nods and says nothing more, though she thinks a while on the three-parted curse used by Ahamkara to mark their prey, the shackle between Appellated and Appalling. When she finishes her memorial bouquet, she unfolds herself and rises to stretch. Riven does the same, and as she relaxes, she spreads and shuffles and shakes her pinions until they all lie straight.\n\nThe land around them is shapeless rock that will become an aubade to those left behind; Mara will honor her enemies and friends alike in stone, she will build grand cathedrals veneered in amethyst and agate.\n\nRiven butts her rounded snout under Mara's hand and waits.\n\n\"Let us find Kelda,\" Mara says."

        "text": "Now in time Uldren Queensbrother returned to the Reef with a new creature. He had killed it twice in ambush, he said, to be certain it could not die. It had once been an Awoken man, and, recognizing it, Mara turned away from her plans for the Dreaming City and watched it coolly.\n\n\"It is a Guardian,\" she said. \"Once it was Chao Mu.\" He had left the Reef alone, knowing that he could never return or see his family again, to repair a failing climate controller in what had once been Earth's Gobi breadbasket. He had said he could not bear to watch the world wither.\n\n\"Bow before the Queen,\" Uldren said, giving him a shove.\n\nThe Awoken man looked at him, then back at Mara. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, bowing. \"My name is Savin.\"\n\n\"You do not remember your wives?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your child, who is now a hundred and ten?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your passion, which was the insulation of minutely sensitive detectors from all but the most specific and subtle radiations?\"\n\nHe did not, except that he said he could touch magnetic fields and loved to tweak the miniscule weave of the circuits in his robe. He had a zoogoer's enthusiasm for particle physics.\n\n\"To what do you owe your loyalty?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu said, \"my Ghost told me that I am a Guardian of the Traveler, reborn in its Light. I was not a day old when your brother waylaid me.\"\n\nAnd he caused to appear from his body a machine like a sphere cradled in a broken cube, which bobbed impertinently and blinked at the Queen. \"You'll make an enemy of the City and every Guardian in it if you keep us against our will,\" the machine warned them. \"But we would gladly be your allies, if you desire it. The City has no idea of your existence, except faint myths among the Awoken on Earth.\"\n\n\"Does it speak for you?\" the Queen challenged Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu.\n\n\"I speak for myself,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu answered. \"Behold!\" And he drew forth from the quantum vacuum a shrieking singularity, which he held between his hands and then telescoped down into nothing.\n\n\"Are you intrinsically good?\" the Queen asked.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he answered. The Queen knew this was a lie or a misapprehension. She was aware of the Risen and the cruel fiefdoms they had sometimes enabled. However, perhaps the Ghosts that had made the Risen were destroyed or became enlightened.\n\nNow the Queen asked the Techeuns to assess the differences between the Chao Mu they remembered and this Savin returned as a Guardian of the Traveler, using their most sensitive physical and psychological tests. Most of all, though, the Queen was curious about the reaction of her Ahamkara, which had begun to salivate, and to assume a form more like the Guardian expected: monstrous and befanged.\n\nBut her brother whispered urgently to her, \"We must know how to kill it, Mara. There are more every day.\" \n\nSavin the Guardian showed a tremendous fondness for doing things; he had a pathologically task-oriented nature, which made him very useful to the Reef. Yet there was always the sense that his Ghost was watching, observing, reporting. And Savin was most of all greedy—not in the grasping manner of the petty, but in an enormous, all-consuming way, for he desired materials and experiences that would temper him into a better Guardian, and he was always experimenting with his strange powers in foolish ways that left him briefly dead, seeking \"a new Super ability\" or \"some way to make my grenades faster.\" He grew tired of performing trivial tasks about the Reef, complaining that the dangerous repairs he made were endless and boring, and that he wanted to move on to new worlds. He leapt into space, repeatedly and without reason, as if his death were no more traumatic than a hop off a curb. Obsessed with reward and efficiency, he would rather do one profitable thing a thousand times than waste his efforts on a less beneficial novelty.\n\nBy the end of her acquaintance with Savin, Mara had decided she did not like this Traveler and what it did to people. Yet she had also decided that she felt a strange kinship and sympathy for it, this cornered, desperate god, making infinite sacrifices out of its people.\n\nPerhaps the Earth would be better off if the Traveler vanished or was destroyed, she thought. Even in the Reef, she felt as if she were living next to a torch held up in a dark wilderness, calling out across the galaxy to hungry things with too many eyes."

Those who do not die are as malleable and passionate as the young, as tempered and constant as the mature, and as wise and humble as the best of the old.\n\nBut as ever, the Awoken were troubled by death. It was easy to imagine a world older and harsher than the Distributary, a world crowded with competitors where the slow-changing and lushly alive Awoken would be helpless beside austere mayfly-quick breeders who adapted with every swift generation.\n\nWhy had the Awoken been spared mortality? Were they, as the Sanguine preached, rewarded for their bravery and fidelity in a past existence? Or were the Eccaleists right? Could all the gifts of the Distributary, all the milk-bright stars above, all the years of Awoken life, be a form of cowardice? Was there an unfought battle down in the center of the Awoken soul? A duty yet to be discharged?\n\nQueen Nguya Pin restored the monarchy to prominence over the Gensym Scribes. This she accomplished after a fateful visit, upon the day of the summer solstice, by a hooded and masked woman who some whispered was Mara Sov and others, the long-vanished Diasyrm. For nine and ninety years (a rhetorical figure meaning a long time), the Queen had been an authority only in the arts and matters spiritual. However, Queen Nguya Pin declared she was now an avowed Eccaleist and that the Queen would lead the quest to identify whatever debt the Awoken owed the cosmos. It was time to pursue a dream beloved to all Awoken: the conquest of space and the assessment of the true shape and age of their universe.\n\nThe ancient court of the Queen gave the Gensym Scribes a place to lay down their pride and act as equals. Soon the greatest engineers in the world assembled in the Queen's court, and whatever wealth or resources they required flowed freely. Great cataracts of men and women spilled around the palace screaming of ramjets and apoapses deep into the night, then awakening to pots of thick black coffee to mumble about metric tensors and cosmic microwave anisotropy.\n\nInto this feast of ideas came Sjur Eido, searching for the woman who had turned Queen Pin to Eccaleism. Sjur smoldered with an ancient fury, for another thing that the immortal may nurture is everlasting vendetta.\n\nSjur Eido deduced who among the Queen's court must be a disguised Mara Sov. She followed the hooded figure to her laboratory and watched Mara go to work soldering a makeshift bolometer to search for signs of primordial gravity waves. Sjur Eido's fury and grief whetted themselves against Mara's thoughtless grace and ancient beauty, until at last her heart unseamed itself and spilled its hot blood in a shout. \"Mara Sov!\" she cried, throwing down her maltech matter laser between them. \"I cannot live while you live, but I cannot bear to kill you. I challenge you to a duel to the agony. I will fight your most beloved companion to the death and leave you forever maimed or else die in the attempt.\"\n\nMara could not refuse this challenge. She summoned Uldren, and with a ruthlessness she was no longer frightened to wield, she told Uldren that he would stand for her in battle to the death against Sjur Eido.\n\n\"We cannot put it all upon a single fight,\" Uldren said to the ancient vendetta-bearer. \"Too much would be left to chance. Such an old grudge deserves to be tested well. I propose we fight with blade, with rifle, and with fifth-generation air superiority fighters.\"\n\nSjur Eido accepted these terms."

        "text": "Now it came to pass that Esila, daughter of Sila, recognized the scent of Sjur Eido, for smell lies deepest in memory. Esila spoke to Queen Nguya Pin about the presence of an ancient hero in her court. While Queen Pin pondered how to honor this visitor—and simmered over the insult of Sjur's unannounced presence—a spy brought word of Sjur Eido's intentions to the Gensym Scribes.\n\nThe many Scribes were troubled by this news, for they had given Sjur Eido license to hunt and kill Mara Sov. If Sjur Eido murdered a guest of the Queen under the Scribes' remit, it would mean war and the end of the great Awoken push for space. Historians were called to the court with bouquets of sweet flowers and grant money to speak of Sjur Eido. \"She was one of Queen Alis Li's Paladins, but she was an Eccaleist, who believed that we would one day be called to repay the gift of our awakening.\"\n\n\"Would she defy the Queen's protection and murder a guest of the court?\" the Scribes asked.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" the historians said, laughing. \"She was a terror.\"\n\nThe Scribes began preparations to flee the Queen's court, as they foresaw Sjur Eido's victory would be blamed on them. Sensing uncertainty, many vital contractors and suppliers withdrew from the space program. The Queen denounced the Gensym Scribes as faithless and selfish, and her Eccaleist followers bristled in rage against the Sanguine majority who had scuttled their dream of flight. Household turned against household, sister against brother, wife against wife. The whole world clenched her fists.\n\nMeanwhile, Sjur Eido and Uldren met each other on a net of woven lianas over a pool of heavy water. The light of the Queen's reactors shimmered beneath them as they took their places. Uldren wore a white chestpiece of ceramic armor over a suit of black tasseled silk, and he wielded a long fractal knife whose cutting edge was nearly three times as long as the blade. Sjur Eido fought in the contoured blue-gray pressure armor of a Paladin with the Star of Eight Edicts blazoned on her chest.\n\nBefore they began, Sjur Eido tore away the sheer curtain over the gardener's nook and looked in on Mara Sov. \"Are you afraid?\" she whispered, half in hatred, half in admiration, all in awe. \"Do you sweat? Does your breath come short?\"\n\nMara pressed her hand to Sjur's faceplate and left no stain. She held Sjur's gauntlet to her heart so Sjur could feel her steady pulse and even breath. \"You don't care about him?\" Sjur pressed her. \"It would mean nothing if I maimed him?\"\n\n\"You ask the right questions,\" Mara said, \"but of the wrong sibling.\"\n\nThen Sjur understood that she fought a man who would always express his love through loss and ordeal.\n\nShe bowed to Uldren and drew her knife. Uldren bowed in mocking reply. They fought across the web of lianas in a slow spiral, creeping like spiders, waiting for the motion of the web beneath them to signal an instant of vulnerability. Then the pounce, the clash, the blur of knives: Sjur Eido's straightforward prisonyard jabs against Uldren's whirling deceptive theater. All of knife fighting is in the seizure and surrender of space: Neither would surrender to the close, the clinch, the berserk adrenaline-sick exchange of thrusts that would leave both dead.\n\nUldren began to cut away key lianas to throw Sjur Eido's footing, and Sjur Eido countered by charging him to keep him off balance. At last, they fell together into the coolant pond. The fight was a draw—but it was only the first of three."

        "text": "Next, the fallen Paladin and the hunter chose long guns and went out into the monsoon jungle to stalk each other. Sjur Eido selected a Tigerspite in 11x90mm with five-round flock guidance and an inertial sump. Uldren chose a silent needle carbine with a conesnail payload. For six weeks, they stalked each other as the political situation grew more dire. He was the better hunter, stealthier in motion and at ease in the wilderness, but Sjur Eido was the better soldier. She had no respect for the systems of the jungle, and she knew how to use that to her advantage. She drove the animals into a frenzy with violence and habitat disruption. Parrots and crows warned each other of Uldren's stealthy hides, and jealous predators forced him off his carefully scouted trails. Sjur Eido caught him with his back against a rift lake and shot him as he tried to cross the lakebed. The wound was not mortal, for the water ruined the terminal ballistics, but she had won the match.\n\n\"Your life is at stake,\" Mara warned her brother. \"Lose this final match, and you will—\"\n\n\"Am I simple?\" he snarled at her. The wound pained him terribly, but he would not risk more than a little analgesic. \"Leave me my work, Sister, or you leave me nothing at all.\"\n\nNow they would meet in air superiority fighters over the Andalayas. Charges under their seats would detonate if either of them left the engagement area. Because of the small combat zone, Sjur Eido chose a nimble Ermine tactical fighter and a payload of all-aspect heatseeking missiles.\n\n\"Where will we receive these aircraft?\" Uldren demanded. \"How can I trust the equipment?\"\n\nSjur Eido told him that one of the Gensym Scribes would provide the aircraft and requested weapons from her personal deterrent stockpile. \"Very well,\" Uldren sniffed. \"And we will have access to all the weapons these airframes can equip?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Sjur said. \"Those we cannot obtain can be replaced by training simulators.\" She was certain Uldren's wound would cripple him.\n\n\"Then I will fly a Dart,\" Uldren said. The ancient interceptor had awful fire control, dismal maneuverability, and primitive weapons.\n\n\"A Dart?\" Sjur jeered. \"Will you fly with its original weapons, too? You think you can beat me with rockets and a gun?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Uldren purred. \"You accept those terms?\" She did.\n\nThe two duelists took to the skies on a bright winter morning. After a fuel check, a telemetry squawk, and a terrain snapshot, they turned in toward each other from a hundred kilometers apart. Sjur Eido descended for the terrain, knowing Uldren's radar could barely separate her from the clutter. Uldren came straight on.\n\nAt eighty kilometers of separation, Uldren called across the radio, \"Fox three. Kill. Engagement over.\" Sjur sneered at the bluff and prepared to climb into a snap attack when the KILLED alert flashed on her Ermine's training panel. She had forgotten that the Dart's intercept loadout, when it had last served seventy years ago, included an unguided air-to-air nuclear rocket. Uldren had simulation-killed her and everything within several klicks.\n\nOn the tarmac, Sjur Eido threw off her helmet and parachute and knelt before Mara Sov. \"My lady,\" she said, \"as I have fought your brother to a tie, I leave my fate in your hands. Be more kind to me than you were to my lady the Diasyrm.\"\n\n\"Rise, Sjur Eido,\" said Mara. \"Let us take the stars together.\""

To hear it is to feel it, and to feel it is to remember that you are a sack of fluids and gels much more than you are a solid entity. Membranes and gradients, solutes and films: a body is a mingled thing. Mara thinks of this as she watches the launch vehicle discard its boosters and climb away through the clouds. The Awoken could have been angels. Instead, they are flesh.\n\n\"That's that.\" Queen Nguya Pin rises from her portable throne, unfolding two heads taller than Mara. \"Choose your replacement. My work is done, and I will stomach no more.\"\n\nMara smiles at her. \"Is a Queen's work ever done?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't insult me,\" Queen Pin clucks. She brushes windblown pollen from her trousers; today's launches have blasted the spring trees with hot wind. \"You used me to do your work, politically and scientifically. You used me to bundle up the Scribes in a neat little scroll for your disposal. I went along with it for the sake of the monarchy, Mara, not because I'm a fool. I don't know what you want or why you're so bent on keeping the Awoken uneasy and dissatisfied. I don't know how you manipulate the acclamations. But when I abdicate, I am going to find Alis Li, wherever she's gone, and ask her all my questions about you. I'm very interested to know the answers.\"\n\n\"You've been a wonderful Queen,\" Mara says. \"No one will ever replace you.\" Although she is thinking of Devna Tel, who was never one of the Scribes, and whose coronation would make a wonderful rebuke to the Scribes' remaining ambitions.\n\nSjur Eido meets her by the ship. \"We'll need a new Queen,\" Mara tells her, leaping up the side of the ramp. \"Word on the satellite?\"\n\n\"Still burning for the Lagrange point. What have you done to Nguya?\"\n\n\"Given her too much perspective, I'm afraid.\" Just as this observatory satellite should help the Awoken see things from Mara's point of view. She smiles as she helps her bodyguard up the ramp, Sjur indulgently pretending that she needs Mara's hand. \"Uldren should be on the ground in Kamarina by now. We'll have a go-ahead on that interferometer buyout when he's done.\"\n\nThere are new stars in the sky. Mara put them there. Huge distributed-array telescopes orbit the Distributary's cool sun; gravity wave sensors and cold primordial neutrino detectors spider the crust. Out of shell corporations and seed investments, she has opened her world as an enormous eye and focused it heavenward. Sjur Eido was her smiling public avatar these past decades, while her brother handled enforcement. The days of covert speed chess in the Queen's court are over: Sjur Eido's open endorsement made Mara the face of Eccaleism and armed Mara with blackmail over all the Gensym Scribes still in power.\n\nYet she has never been so lonely or so worried for the future. Mother has told her that she, Mara, uses her power over Uldren too freely; that she must learn to stop, or her mother will no longer be her friend.\n\n\"Mara?\" Sjur says, catching some flickering expression. Knowing Mara well, she immediately changes tack away from comfort. \"What do you think we'll find with the satellite?\"\n\n\"Proof that it's time for us to go,\" Mara says. \"Proof of what I've known since the beginning.\"\n\nSjur frowns in thought. She doesn't remember much from before her awakening. Few of the 891 do—but enough to trouble her. \"Time for us to go…\"\n\nThe ship's turbines keen up to speed and then settle into whisper-quiet cruise. Sjur reaches to strap herself in across from Mara. Impulsively, hard-faced, denying she needs what she is asking for, Mara scoots aside to make room on her bench. Sjur raises an eyebrow at her.\n\n\"Don't say anything,\" Mara warns her. \"Not a word.\" And so they pass the flight in silence, but not alone."

She has stoked their curiosity with thirty years of painstaking analysis. When they look up at the night sky, they see the stars of her observatories among the crowded bands of habitats, the spindly orbital factories, towering elevator counterweights, the burning roads of matter streams.\n\n\"Let me tell you of our world,\" she says.\n\nThere are the facts of tectonics and atmosphere, of water and climate: the parameters of the sun that feeds them. \"No infants died last year. No child went unfed. No youth came of age illiterate, no one suffered illness who might have been treated. We have long surpassed the eutech gathered from Shipspire; yet we have grown carefully and cleanly. We have eluded pollution, eradicated plague, and chosen peace. No maltech weapon has been discharged in centuries. Our atomic weapons were dismantled before they could ever be used. We are our own triumph.\"\n\nShe has elected not to use graphics or theater. She would rather they remember her face.\n\n\"You know yourselves,\" she says. \"Let me tell you of your cosmos. We live in a spatially infinite, isotropic universe 12.1 billion years old. Its metallicity is ideal for life and for the spread of technological civilizations. In time, the distance between all points in the universe will contract to zero, and the cosmos will collapse into a singularity, to be reborn in fire. There will be no end to eternity here.\"\n\nShe pauses. She waits. The whole world is out there, begging for the answer to the question.\n\n\"Our world is a gift. And we must refuse it.\"\n\nThey are Awoken. They love secrets. They will wait for her to explain.\n\n\"We have detected a pattern that was imprinted into our universe by its ancestor: a fingerprint of the initial conditions into which existence was born. From this information, we have confirmed the most primordial of Awoken myths. Our universe is a subset of another. We live within a singularity, a knot in space-time, that orbits a star in another world.\n\n\"Conventional relativity would suggest that time outside an event horizon passes quickly compared to a clock within, but our universe has a peculiar relationship with its mother. Thousands of years have passed for us on the Distributary. Outside? Centuries, at most. We are a swift eddy in a slow river.\n\n\"These ideas may not surprise you after centuries of theorizing and philosophy. But we have decrypted new data from the cosmic microwave and neutrino background signals. We have discovered voices… the voices of distress calls. They tell a story of bravery, of war, and of desperate loss.\n\n\"We were not always immortal. We did not earn this utopia by covenant with any cosmic power, or by attaining an enlightened moral condition. We are refugees. We fled from an apocalyptic clash between our ancestors' civilization and an invading power.\" She lowers her eyes. \"The signals we have retrieved tell us that our ancestors were on the edge of defeat. Perhaps extinction.\"\n\n\"It is time that we accept our debt. The Distributary is a refuge, not a birthright; a base to rebuild our strength, not a garden to tend. I ask you, Awoken, to join me in the hardest and most worthy task a people has ever faced. We must leave our heaven, return to the world of our ancestors, and take up the works they abandoned. If some of them survive, we must offer aid. If they have enemies, we must share our strength. We must go back to the war we fled and face our enemies there.\"\n\nShe lets them dangle a moment before she drives it home. \"We have also determined that our birthright, our immortality, is tied to the fundamental traits of this universe. Once we leave, we will begin to age again. In time, we will all die.\n\n\"Will you join me, Awoken? Will you answer my call? All I offer you is hardship and death. All I ask is everything you can offer. But you will see an older starlight. You will walk in a deeper dark than this world has ever known.\""

        "text": "\"You're the devil,\" Alis Li whispers. \"I remember… in one of the old tongues, Mara means death.\"\n\nAn hour before. Mara's ship touches down a polite two kilometers from the Pearl Groves, and she looks out across mazes of channel and tidal pond to the compounds of ancient silver-white stone beyond. Two-ton oysters glitter in the shallows, their shells jeweled with mineral inclusions. Seabirds peck and fret along narrow white beaches. Mara lifts up her black formal skirts and begins her long walk into Alis Li's retreat, the sanctuary of former Queens.\n\n\"Mara,\" Uldren whispers, through her throat mic. \"Don't do this. Take Sjur with you, at least.\"\n\nBut she has to do this, or she'll never be able to face herself again.\n\nThe sun batters at her. She hides under a parasol, but heat gathers in the folds of her garment, in the soles of her shoes. When she squints against the glare, she thinks she can see the shining grains of her fleet in orbit: the Hulls, built under eutech supervision to the specifications of radically post-conscious AI that will one day fly between worlds. It is far too late to stop the project now. Far, far too late for second thoughts: exactly twelve point one billion years too late, really. For Mara in particular.\n\nMara kicks the sand and trudges on.\n\nShe's in a foul mood when she reaches the old Queen's house, but the sight of Alis Li sitting on the porch with a battered tea service makes her smile. \"Thank you for seeing me,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. I was afraid you'd leave the universe without saying goodbye.\" Alis pours her a cup of cool blackberry tea. \"Have a seat. How's Queen Tel?\"\n\n\"She has declined to endorse my expedition,\" Mara admits, tucking her feet beneath her on the wide wooden deck chair. The tea is too sweet, but so blissfully cool. \"I'm sure you understand her reasons.\"\n\n\"You mean she's declined to endorse the sudden violent severance of tens of thousands of threads from the tapestry of our society? How surprising.\" Alis looks Mara over, critically, then sits back to sigh. \"A Scribe once told me that the definition of a utopia is a place where every single person's happiness is necessary to everyone else. You're going to make a lot of unhappy people, Mara. You'll make the lives of everyone in the world tangibly worse. Not just those you've lured to certain death, but those who will grieve their departure, and all those who will come to grief for lack of labor and knowledge you took with you.\"\n\n\"My people volunteered.\"\n\n\"Your mother told you,\" Alis says, \"that it is one thing for you to have a particular power over people, but another thing entirely to deny that you are using it.\"\n\n\"You once told me,\" Mara counters, \"that I had to consider the symbol people made out of me, and that if it were good, then I had to be that symbol for them. I had to perform as they required. I have done so. I have been the best thing I can think to be.\"\n\n\"Is this the best thing you could think to be?\" Alis says, with very practiced neutrality.\n\nMara drinks her tea in delicate silence.\n\nThe old Queen sets her cup down hard enough to chip. Mara jumps in quiet shock: The tea service is an heirloom from Shipspire. Her face hardens with the power of ancient command. \"Mara. I'm at least as clever as you. Do me the credit of acknowledging it.\"\n\n\"I have worked for many hundreds of years to arrange this outcome,\" Mara says, forthrightly, but without the courage to look Alis Li right in the eyes. \"I have nurtured and tended the Eccaleist belief so that there will always be Awoken who feel uncomfortable in paradise. Guilty for the gift of existence in the Distributary. People who'll come with me.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Alis lays a hand on Mara's, and for a moment the touch almost makes Mara sigh in gratitude: to be seen, to be known, without revulsion. Then Alis' old strength pins her palm to the table.\n\n\"The Diasyrm?\" Alis hisses. \"The Theodisy War? Did you arrange it all?\""

Have you reckoned the full cost?\"\n\nShe has convinced tens of thousands of Awoken to abandon their immortality. She has deprived the Distributary an infinite quantity of joy, companionship, labor, and discovery: all the works that might be accomplished by all the people who will join her in her mission to another world. When she lies awake at night, seized by anxiety, she tries to tally up the loss in her head, but it is too huge, and it becomes a formless thing that stalks her down the pathways of her bones like the creak of a gravity wave.\n\n\"Some infinities are larger than others,\" she tells her old captain. \"I believe… we are here for a reason, and this is the way to fulfill that purpose.\"\n\n\"And how much would you sacrifice? Your mother? Your brother? Are the Awoken real to you at all?\" Alis leans across her pinned hand, viper-fierce, striking. \"Do you think my people were made to die for you?\"\n\n\"Not for me. For our purpose. For our fate.\"\n\n\"For a home we abandoned. It's in the charter, Mara. The document on Shipspire that,\" and even Alis Li falls into a hush as she broaches one of the primal mysteries, her memory of creation, \"that shaped the… the way I made this universe.\"\n\n\"You were the first,\" Mara acknowledges. \"The first one here laid down the rules.\"\n\nAlis Li releases her hand and collapses back into her chair. \"Why are you here, Mara?\"\n\nTo tell you the truth at last. \"To ask you for that boon you owe me.\"\n\n\"At last.\" Alis sighs. \"Well, I knew the day would come. I think I'll be glad to have this weight off my shoulders. You'll ask me to throw my support behind your mission, won't you? The First Queen says, go with Mara; awaken from this dream and go fight for your home. Is that it?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says, with her heart in her throat, with trepidation bubbling in her gut. You cannot keep a secret buried like a vintage for so many centuries, and then unbottle it without any ceremony. \"The boon I ask is your forgiveness.\"\n\nThen she explains the truth. She tells Alis Li what she did: about the choice Alis Li would have made, if Mara had not made her own first. It's only an extension of what Alis has already deduced.\n\nWhen she's finished, her ancient captain's jaw trembles. Her hands shake. A keen slips between her clamped teeth. The oldest woman in the world conjures up all the grief she has ever felt, and still it is not enough to match Mara's crime.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Alis Li whispers. \"I remember… in one of the old tongues, Mara means death. Oh, that's too perfect. That's too much.\"\n\nShe laughs for a while. Mara closes her eyes and waits.\n\n\"You realize,\" Alis Li says, breathing hard, \"that this is the worst thing ever done. Worse than stealing a few thousand people from heaven. Worse than that thing we fled, before we were Awoken—\"\n\n\"Please,\" Mara begs. \"Please don't say that.\"\n\nAlis Li rises from her chair. \"I'll support your fleet,\" she says. \"I'll use every favor and connection I have to get your Hulls completed and through the gateway—and I will do it so that I can hasten your departure from this world. I will do it out of hate for you; I will do it so that every good and great thing we achieve here will ever after be denied to you, you snake. No forgiveness. Do you understand me? It is unforgivable. Go. Go!\"\n\n\"I'd be very glad if you didn't tell my mother,\" Mara says.\n\nAlis Li hurls the pitcher of blackberry tea over Mara, turns, and goes inside, leaving her to trudge, wet and sticky but unbowed, back to her ship. She leaves her tea-stained parasol on the deck, but when she remembers it and looks back, it is already gone."

World of laughing Corsairs, world of breathless forest hunts, world of mountains flickering with pale Cherenkov fire, world of sweet berry-stained lips and mathematical insight pure as a rhodium chime. She will never see it again.\n\nMara thinks of her mother. She doesn't want to but she does, and the memory blindfolds her and muzzles her and plugs her ears so she can hear nothing but Osana's voice on that final night. They're tipsy together, and the evening has wrapped around to morning. Now they sit side by side, mother and daughter, watching the sun rise over the Chriseiad range from Osana's little ranch house on the tundra.\n\n\"I'm not coming with you,\" Osana says.\n\nMara has been so afraid of this answer for so long that she actually giggles. This can't be happening, of course. This is a nightmare; one of those stress dreams where your powers of persuasion and manipulation fail. \"Sure, Mom,\" she says, \"you've got a ranch to run, after all. More?\"\n\n\"No thank you.\" Osana squints into the dawn. Little age creases surround her eyes, illegible encryption, unbroken despite Mara's centuries of effort. The rising light draws a tear. \"You'll have to send my goodbyes to Uldren. He's not speaking to me.\"\n\n\"What?\" Mara gasps, as if this is the real shock, and not losing her mother forever. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I already told him I wasn't coming with you. I'm happy here.\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Mara says, with rising anger, \"I'm happy here too. That's not the point—\" A conversation that did not so much end as beat itself to an unsustainable emotional pulp, hours later. No catharsis. No closure.\n\nBack in the present: \"Weapons,\" Uldren calls. \"Go flight.\"\n\n\"Go flight,\" Mara confirms. \"The clock is counting. L minus five minutes.\" Directly off her Hull's bow, a sphere of ultradense mass waits for the moment of implosion and collapse. There will be only moments to transit the wormhole before it evaporates.\n\n\"Flight, Sensor,\" Sjur Eido calls. \"I have anomalous starfield occlusions, bearing—\"\n\n\"Intercept!\" Mara shouts. \"They're missiles!\" It had to happen. Someone had to try to stop the departure, someone good and Paladin-pure who believes they are saving tens of thousands of Awoken from madness and doom.\n\n\"Flight, FIDO. Do we abort?\"\n\n\"Negative!\" Mara snaps. \"The countdown is go! Weapons, kill the inbounds!\"\n\nSjur Eido grunts in dismay. \"They're going to get through,\" she says. \"Five or six, at least.\"\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara opens their personal channel with the thought of his face. \"Reassign your guns to protect the gateway.\"\n\n\"We'll lose Hulls, Mara—\"\n\n\"I know. Do it.\" Mara opens the command interface for the gateway and sends the image of a bloody thorn. The countdown skips instantly to zero. \"All ships, we are aborting directly to launch. Brace for acceleration!\"\n\nShe issues the emergency launch order.\n\nThe Hull screams with thrust. Mara's suit floods with cushioning gel. She thinks of her mother's face, trying to fix it perfectly in her mind, and her sensorium tries, vainly, to open a channel to Osana. As the Hull plunges into the singularity, the last thing Mara sees is the mournful error message: No connection. No connection. No connection. Cannot connect to Osana."

Upward, the black umbrella of the shield and the matter storage, and the docked ships which make Yang Liwei not just a mothership, but an entire traveling fleet. Down below, along the slim spine of the ship, the shielded bulb of the engine glows invisibly infrared.

She thinks you cannot help but love Earth if you grow up in space. You love Earth the way all adolescents secretly adore two-century-old video of nai nai and ye ye dancing on New Year's Eve. Earth does not ask too much. The colonies are demanding parents, but Earth is like a chill old grandam, simmering in weird art and weirder ideas, enthroned upon ecology older than Human time. Earth was the first terraformed world. Life made Earth livable.\n\nShe is going with Yang Liwei and the rest of Project Amrita to make new worlds.\n\nShe came because she saw an omen in a man's death. She was on EVA with him, repairing a jammed radiator fin on an uncrewed circum-Jovian platform. They worked in companionable silence, listening to the howl of the Jovian magnetosphere when it happened. A frozen rabbit embryo came out of deep space at forty kilometers per second and went through his faceplate. The rabbit must have been spilled in a biocontainer accident far from the sun to plunge back inward like a comet.\n\nImmediately afterward—for reasons very clear to her because she has always had a sense for the meaning of things, reasons very difficult to explain to others because she has always felt this sense was secret—she asked her mother if the family could travel with Project Amrita.\n\nAmrita: the drink that endeth drinking, the bottomless cup. It is the quest to spread far beyond the solar system and to end Human dependence on the Traveler. It calls to those who see Humanity as a cocoon, an instar, a form ready to be shed.\n\nShe is an Auturge 3rd Class, a self-motivating subsystem of the ship's inclusive ecology, a term that spans technology, biology, and behavior, all of which must be maintained for the mission to succeed. Her task is to locate problems and report them to an Auturge 2nd Class, who will give her the tools she needs to repair them. But she never speaks to her 2nd. She never tells anyone about the problems she finds. Instead she fixes them herself. Her work has therefore assumed a magical quality: She appears where there is trouble, and shortly afterward, the trouble goes away. People have begun to leave gifts for her. Some of these gifts are questions. She answers the questions with a quiet confidence some would argue she has not earned. She knows she sees more of their lives than they see of hers—and that this mystery, this seeing-without-being-seen, grants her a kind of power that is like wisdom.\n\nShe lives outside the ship, suited and cocooned in a layer of cytogel, which keeps her surgically clean. She misses the wild zero-gravity fashions of her upbringing, clothes like drifting jellyfish that squirm away from snags, self-correcting darts in the fabric, silk like cool spilled alcohol. She misses the sense of oil and sweat on her skin, for the suit leaves her so clean that she feels skinned raw.\n\nStill, she stays out here because she wants to feel the changing taste of starlight as the universe ahead blue-shifts. As Yang Liwei accelerates toward lightspeed, it moves faster and faster into the light coming from ahead. If light were like dust, it would strike Yang faster, but light can never change speed, so it gains energy instead. Red light is low energy, and blue-violet light is high energy, so the universe becomes blue.\n\nEven now, the very tip of the visual spectrum, violet-blue light, is shifting up into invisible ultraviolet, the color of speed, the color of future."

        "text": "\"Mara!\" the fighter shouts, delighted, and a punch shuts him concussively up. It's a real good hit, a thunderous uppercut to the point of the jaw. Mara hears his teeth grind across each other, down into lip-flesh and shredded gums. She cringes in silent sympathy. He loses his grip on the equipment rack and tumbles out into zero gravity in a big arc of blood. His opponent goes for the coup de gras, kicks off hard and catches him in the stomach like a Human torpedo. They plunge together toward the killzone painted on the floor.\n\nUldwyn grins messily at Mara over his opponent's shoulder. He's fighting a big, brutal woman from Gravity Ops, a woman who's had her myostatin genes knocked out so she can swell up into a giant plug of brawn. Uldwyn doesn't have a chance. He took the fight for the same reason he wanted to join the Amrita expedition—he measures himself by the bravery of his losses. By what he can survive losing.\n\nHe applies a blood choke. It's the right move, but it doesn't matter. The woman groans, grays out, goes limp—but Uldwyn can't get out from beneath her sheer inertia before he hits the killzone. The bell goes off. Uldwyn groans as his rail-hard body forcibly decelerates his opponent's entire mass. Events have built up momentum, and he is just in the way.\n\n\"What did you lose?\" Mara asks him.\n\nHe lies there panting and grinning, shedding perfectly round spheres of blood. \"It's good to see you inside. What brought you?\"\n\nShe and her fraternal twin never answer each other's questions directly. Mara is cool with this because she feels like words are a very bad system of encryption, and that if you really want to communicate with someone, you must develop your own special one-to-one cryptosystem. The ideal statement, Mara feels, would be indecipherable to anyone but the person it's spoken to—and even then, only if they know you are the one speaking.\n\n\"I got you some pictures,\" she says, pushing the big woman off him, eliciting a fuzzy \"oh hi Mara.\" \"Full sensorium captures. You can trade them for the parts I need.\"\n\nUldwyn helps the big woman pull herself vertical, but his eyes are narrow on Mara. Not because he's sore at the idea of helping her—he's always liked bartering, bargaining, the hustle—but because he knows what kind of black market wants these captures. \"How far off the hull did you take them?\"\n\nHow far off? All the way off. They are in zero gravity because Yang Liwei shut off its engines for an inspection cycle. So while Uldwyn got in prize fights, Mara kicked off Yang Liwei's forward shield and coasted ten kilometers into pure void, tethered by only a thread-thin molecular line. She ordered her suit's cytogel to gather around her face. Then, only then, she overrode every sanity system in her softsuit and commanded it to retract into storage mode.\n\nThe suit peeled away like rind and she was drifting in hard vacuum.\n\nThe void boiled the water off her skin. Her body swelled with unchecked pressure until her undersuit forced it to stop. Alarmed cytogel crawled down her throat, hissing emergency oxygen: not enough. Her skin blued with cyanosis. She was bathed in the most profound emptiness.\n\nShe recorded all of it at the neural level. The exquisite darkness. The sense of fatal independence from all things. There are those who will give anything to feel that void.\n\n\"You can't keep doing this,\" Uldwyn complains, as the big woman stares at Mara in awe. \"Mom is going to die of worry.\""

As far as Mara can tell, Osana is the apex of a centuries-long project to create the ultimate embarrassing mom. She is also very blunt: \"Mara, even when you were little, you wanted me to treat you like an adult. So I have. But you remember what I told you, don't you? If you don't want to be my daughter, I can't watch over you like a mother would. I can't put you first, like a mother would. I will always be your friend, but I have to make my own choices too.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean you had to tell the Captain!\"\n\nThey walk shoulder-to-shoulder down the companionway to Captain Li's wardroom. Mara keeps trying to get a step ahead, to lead, but Osana somehow matches her every time. \"Of course I did,\" Osana says. \"You started a cult, Mara. If I didn't say something to the Captain, Behavior would've had this conversation with you instead. Do you want that?\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything. People liked my captures. People left me presents, spare parts, tips—then Uldwyn got into it, you know how he is—\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Osana wheels on her. \"For shame, Mara. You know your brother will follow anywhere you lead. You know he's not capable of the same, ah,\" her lips twitch, \"imperial remove. You knew he'd brag about you living on the hull—and you let him do it. It is one thing to have a particular power over people, Mara. But it is another to deny that you are using it.\"\n\nMara thinks she can come up with a stinging retort, given a few more paces, but it's too late. The hatch to Captain Li's wardroom swings open. Mara is terrified of this place. This is where Captain Alice Li, divine presence in Mara's life, interfaces with the officers who are the manifestations of her will. Since Mara wants to be Alice Li someday, the wardroom makes Mara feel like she is an usurper princess scoping out her rival's court.\n\nCaptain Li offers them tea. Mara cannot imagine the ways in which she is butchering what must be an intricate and meaningful tea ceremony. Li serves some very battered pre-Traveler ceramic sloshing with hot green tea, then immediately adulterates her own cup with milk from the Cow Thing on the biodeck.\n\n\"Revolting, isn't it?\" She smiles at Mara's bewildered horror. \"You should've seen what I put in my tea when I was camping in Mongolia. I understand your colleague, who is also your mother, has some concerns about your relationship with the rest of the crew?\"\n\n\"My darling Mara,\" Osana says, \"has—entirely by accident, I'm sure—cultivated a reputation as a minor divinity. Her captures from outside the ship are hot items for barter. People draw fan art. There are… tips left for her.\"\n\n\"You take captures while EVA, sometimes without a suit?\" Li nods. \"Yes, I've played one. A remarkable sensation.\" This makes Mara grin impetuously. \"Mara, you are an Auturge, a volunteer. I cannot order you to stop, and your work is exemplary. Are you putting anyone else in danger with your… art projects?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"Just myself.\"\n\n\"False!\" Li barks. \"That is a selfish answer. You are now a symbol to my crew, a house god. If you were to die, they would lose something important, something Human that they have created out of loneliness and void. It would be an unforgettable reminder of the hostile nothingness that surrounds us. When you endanger yourself, you endanger that symbol. You are part of this mission's behavioral armor, Mara.\"\n\nMara is thunderstruck. She's never thought about it this way. \"All I did was take some captures. I didn't ask to be anyone's… mascot.\"\n\n\"You presented yourself as a conduit to secret knowledge,\" Captain Li counters. \"People made something out of you, Mara. Please take this from a starship captain: What people make of you, what they create of you—even without your consent—becomes a kind of responsibility. If the Mara they see when they look at you is good for them, then you have some duty to be that Mara.\" She looks to Osana. \"What about your boy? He's in medical more often than any of the other underground fighters.\"\n\nIt does not surprise Mara that Captain Li knows about the fights. \"My son,\" Osana says, \"is determined to be his own worst enemy. Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Li studies them coolly. \"I keep an ear out for… curious personalities. People who might be suited to long-term isolation while the rest of us are in cryo. People who awaken when others sleep.\""

No response comes from the transient contact twelve and a half light minutes away. The ghost has stalked Yang Liwei for eighteen hours now, closing in each time it appears, and Captain Alice Li is wary of it. Other colony missions have vanished during their outward burns—victims of mishap or hostility—and because of these disappearances, Project Amrita did not hurl itself fearless into the void. Rather, they came armed to the molars.\n\n\"Let's give them a fright,\" she decides. \"Cut the main engine.\"\n\nThe ship's AI executes the command, but a crewperson confirms and calls the order back. \"MECO, aye aye.\"\n\n\"Launch a distributed antenna. Heat up the targeting radar for a full fusion-powered snapshot. We'll take their picture and see what we see.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" the comm officer calls. \"I've got… something weird here.\"\n\n\"Is our phantom saying hello?\"\n\n\"No. It's a neutrino tightbeam from SOLSECCENT.

The whole solar system is now… now under Warmind control.\" Comm dismisses her sensorium, goes to her hard controls, as if she thinks this might be some kind of virtual prank. \"We're… being conscripted.\"\n\nAlice smashes these ideas together in her head like a child banging rocks. They are so preposterous, so stupid, that she cannot even begin to manipulate them coherently. \"We're WHAT?\"\n\n\"We've been commissioned as an auxiliary warship. We are ordered to,\" Comm swallows in disbelief, \"to kill our exit trajectory and assume a heliocentric orbit. That comes with explicit instructions to suicide burn our engines until they are destroyed. Rasputin will transmit targeting coordinates so we can use our Kinetic weapons as… long-range artillery. We'll be recovered 'after the crisis is concluded.'\"\n\n\"Details! What kind of crisis?\"\n\n\"It's a SKYSHOCK event, ma'am. Uh, that's a hostile extrasolar arrival.\"\n\nCaptain Li clamps the mask of command authority over her face. \"Transmit a request for clarification.\"\n\n\"Belay the antenna, Captain?\"\n\n\"No. Scale it up, add telescopes to the swarm, get me a full system survey.

Project Amrita demanded the cutting edge of Human science. It says that in the mission charter, which everyone's been rereading. The Captain has called a vote.\n\nShould Yang Liwei turn home?\n\n\"What if the ship starts accelerating?\" Uldwyn has already, of course, leapt after her. His envy-yellow softsuit glows with gentle bioluminescence. \"We'd just fall forever.\"\n\n\"We'd fall into the stars. We're still on a solar escape trajectory. Yang would just outrun us.\"\n\n\"At least we'd still be going the right direction.\"\n\nShe doesn't think she's given anything away, but somehow he knows. \"Mara.\" He looks up frowning, his face bigger and brighter than the distant Sun. \"You want to go back, don't you? You're going to vote to return.\"\n\nMara thinks that if she looked him in the eye he would see the truth, the turmoil, the half-formed yes.\n\n\"Mara. You don't have to tell me how…\" He swallows the hitch in his voice. \"I've seen how bad it is. I've watched it long enough to know that it's not going to get better. They're gambling everything on the Traveler. We came out here to get away from it. To step off the easy path. Why would we go back?\"\n\nBecause I asked us to leave, Mara thinks. Because something came out of deep space and killed the man next to me, and I saw the omen, and I said we should go. And now I feel like a coward.\n\n\"We might make a difference,\" she says. \"There are other ships…\"\n\n\"We'd be dead before we saved a single soul.\"\n\nHe's right. She doesn't want him to be right, but he's right. And she cannot withdraw into some silent place where she is above this choice.\n\nThey drift in silence until Yang Liwei's silver stem rushes up to meet them. Mara spins, uncoils, and lands in a crouch. Uldwyn comes down on his hands and springs up grinning.

We don't owe them our dreams.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she says. \"I know.\"\n\nThe EVA GUARD channel pops into her sensorium. \"Everyone should get inside,\" Captain Li calls. \"Our friend is closing in on us, and we need to maneuver.\""

The universe blackened: a shroud of nothingness drawn over Yang Liwei, its forty thousand sleeping passengers, its nine hundred crew, and maybe even the whole solar system. There is no way to know, because there is no way to see anything beyond the hull. The vacuum itself has become hostile to the propagation of light. Darkness surrounds them.\n\nThe ship bucks on a storm sea as space-time ripples with gravity tides.\n\n\"Report!\" Captain Li calls. Her sensorium blazes with positional telemetry from ring-laser gyros, beacon satellites, pulsar fixes, cosmic microwave background texture, galactic EM-field terrain mapping: every single instrument useless, crashed, spitting nonsense. \"Sound off by stations!\"\n\n\"FIDO,\" the flight dynamics officer calls. \"Main engine on safe. Thrusters firing erratically. Attitude control keeps crashing to manual.\"\n\n\"Guidance. I have no position. I cannot get a vector. We're moving, but I can't tell how or where.\"\n\n\"INCO. No external comms. Internal networks are dropping in and out.\"\n\nAn incredible sensation washes over Captain Li. A rumble and a thrum down in her gut, in her marrow, in the lowest, basest elements of her body. It is the vibration, the sound of the very fabric of her being scrunching up and stretching out; the distance between the atoms of her body collapses, then expands. The cycle repeats again and again. For a moment, she feels her fingertips and toes pulled away from her core, yanked by tidal forces. It feels like the lowest rumble of the biggest subwoofer ever built. It sounds like the deep voice of God whispering ASMR directly into her ear. It tingles, it thrills, and it leaves in its wake a subsonic tint of dread and anticipation.\n\nShe shivers. \"Gravity wave,\" she says. \"Talk to me, Geode.\"\n\nThe Space-Time Geodesics Officer looks like she's just been hand-delivered a Nobel. \"This is amazing!\" she crows, fully aware that she and everyone else are about to die, but transported away from such temporal concerns by scientific rapture. \"Can you feel that growl? We're experiencing high-frequency, high-amplitude gravity waves. Phaeton strikes. Axions decaying through the hull. Sterile neutrinos. It's all coming from a source at bearing, uh, zero four five mark zero three zero relative, range—range highly variable.\"\n\nAnother wave tears through Yang Liwei. Everything in the ship simultaneously compresses and stretches as the gravity wave deforms the space-time metric. \"Is it the phantom?\" Li demands, as her ship thrums subsonically. \"Is that phantom ship emitting these waves?\"\n\n\"I have no idea!\" GEOD says, exultantly. \"None of this makes any sense at all! Wow!\"\n\nAlice Li has the distinct sense that something ancient and malevolent is operating upon them: a trillion-fingered hand reaching in to caress the very atoms of their being, setting protons a-spin, strumming nerves like guitar strings. A tongue with ten billion slithering forks tasting the surface of their brains. The sense of imminent doom crescendos. She knows, absolutely and utterly, that what is about to happen to her and to her crew is far worse than death. The darkness knows them now. The thing that has come to kill Humanity has their taste.\n\n\"INCO.\" She clings to her restraint harness as the ship growls through another wave. Her bones creak as they stretch. \"Last report on the Traveler? Any sign of an intervention?\"\n\n\"It was at Earth, Captain, and there were high-yield weapon discharges all over the signal. Nothing else.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" Well. She did not fly this far to look back and beg for salvation from an alien god. Pinned to the center of her sensorium is the blazing ledger of her crew's vote: We go onward. We do not turn home. Our fate lies ahead, not behind.\n\n\"Launch an antennae,\" she orders. \"I want every probe and satellite we've got outside.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" INCO protests, \"the vacuum's not signal-permissive—\"\n\n\"We're still passing signals internally, aren't we? Use hardline! Run filament between the satellites! I want a transmitter sail out there, and I want to broadcast.\"\n\nHer flight crew stares. \"Captain?\" FIDO says. \"Broadcast what?\"\n\n\"A declaration of neutrality.\" Alice Li grits her teeth against another wave. It rattles her molars in her skull. \"Whatever's out there, it came for the Traveler. We tell it we're not part of this war. We've seceded from Human existence under the Traveler. We demand to be treated as a separate species, not party to baseline Humanity's conflicts.\n\n\"And we pray there's something out there that cares about the difference.\""

She cannot bear to let anyone see her fear or her awe at the scale of destruction or her pity for the billions of souls dying in darkness back around Sol. She cannot be among the other crew as they cling to each other and whisper reassurances; not even with her mother. She cannot surrender her mystery.\n\nSo she kicks off the hull on fifty kilometers of tether.\n\nBut there's no starlight to die in. The darkness is absolute. Gravity waves tug on her line, pulling her back toward Yang and then hurling her away. In time, she feels another vibration in the line. \"Sister,\" the tether transmits. \"I'm coming out to get you.\"\n\nBrother, she thinks, you'll lose yourself trying to follow me.\n\nCaptain Li's voice breaks through the static, drawn out to a mumble and then compressed to a shriek. Spikes of hard radiation go through her words like bullets, spattering phonemes into eerie compression artifacts. \"This is the interstellar vessel Yang Liwei to the entity interacting with us. We are not involved in your dispute with the powers around this star. We are on a mission to begin a new life elsewhere. Our purpose is orthogonal to yours. We request your indifference…\"\n\nMara's tether trembles with Uldwyn's progress. She holds it in one hand and reaches out with the other, gripping the emptiness, feeling how the tides of broken space pull at her fingertips. She senses that the nothingness around her is not indifferent; that it is aware of all purposes, and that its own purpose encompasses them. It is infinitely hostile because it must be.\n\nSuddenly, as if the void around her has just spontaneously Big Banged, she sees light.\n\nA point of pure white shines in the cosmic distance. Not just visible luminance—her suit decomposes the spectrum—but light in the radio bands, in microwave, keening ultraviolet, a spike of gamma, a total and all-embracing radiation. It sings. It chatters. It speaks in a voice older than suns. She feels that she could Fourier the voice for a century and never decompose it into its parts. It is awesome and appalling and piercingly true. Mara understands how those who die in radiation accidents must feel: A single flash of invisible power sears away all possible futures except one. She feels her soul itself has been ionized, blasted into a higher energy state.\n\nThe light pierces the darkness. Not like the sunrise, not like a wall or a flood, but a single crepuscular ray—a finger of radiance that reaches out through deepest night to touch her. It illuminates Mara, Uldwyn, and Yang Liwei.\n\nIt is not quite enough. It cannot vanquish the shadow.\n\nThus Mara finds herself drifting on the edge of the Light and the Darkness, on the dusk-and-dawn gradient between the two.\n\nShe feels a contest. A battle fought, an equilibrium reached: not a truce, but an infinite limit, like an equation dividing by zero, a collision of two violent eternities. Mara queries Yang Liwei for telemetry and her sensorium fills with the terrified scream of gravitational instruments. She howls too, a feral sound, ecstatic and lost: a wolf baying at the stars. She knows what's happening. Too much power has gathered here. The universe is appalled by the paradox. Nothing that has glimpsed this collision of infinitudes can be allowed to escape. The cosmos must censor its embarrassment. It must sequester the anomaly.\n\nThe slope of warped space-time around them has become too steep, and now every path outward or forward bends back to the center where Light and Dark collide. The definition of \"future\" has become synonymous with the definition of \"inward.\" This is why it's called an event horizon: For an object within the horizon, the path of all future things that can be done or seen leads inevitably down to the center. All events lead inward.\n\nA singularity is forming around her. A kugelblitz: a black hole created by the concentration of raw energy.\n\n\"Mara!\" Uldwyn shouts. \"Mara, you're too far out!\"\n\nMara thinks of her mother's face. She hears Osana say: I can't watch over you like a mother would. I have to make my own choices now.\n\nShe fires the detach command into the tether.\n\nGravity seizes her. She falls forward in space and time, into the future, into the mystery. Yang Liwei is behind her. Uldwyn is behind her. She wants to be the first."

The head of the spear is a metal dish, kilometers across, buried in bedrock.\n\n\"I don't know what this is,\" Alis says. \"I only know that it's mine.\"\n\nThey pass inside.\n\n\"There should be others,\" Mara says afterward. \"There was room for others. Thousands of others. Where are they?\"\n\n\"They're in the same place you came from. We have to make them real.\" Li stares at Mara, and coruscations of white fire map the tiny lines and furrows of her skin. Her bright eyes narrow. \"Why were you the second? Why you in particular?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Mara lies. It is the first lie ever told, the first secret kept."

        "text": "Two became four, and the four called out, and so the four became eight. In this manner, conjured forth by their doubling, the sleepers did awaken. In time the awoken spilled across the face of the world, and their number was forty thousand eight hundred ninety one. They drank of the sweet rain, and they ate of the fruit of the forest, and the starlight pooled as clear oil on their skin. First of their tongues was Speech, and the first of their hunting weapons was the bow.\n\nNow the awoken called out for a name to distinguish World from Unworld. The eight hundred ninety one said to the forty thousand, \"Let this world be named Tributary, for we dream of a great river from which we have parted.\" But the forty thousand were troubled, and they asked to know their antecedent, the place from which they came. \"We did not awaken from the sleep that we entered,\" said the forty thousand. \"In our rest we passed through some terminus and our atavism was severed from us. How did it happen thus?\"\n\nSo a council was called at the place where the rivers met to determine the nature and purpose of existence. Here was undertaken the first census, which counted thirty thousand one hundred eleven women, ten thousand two hundred ninety five men, and four hundred eighty five otherwise. A fear arose among the awoken that the men and otherwise would be lost.\n\nAlis Li spoke first in council, but at the urging of Uldren, many sought out Mara for secret conclave. Among these were Kelda Wadj, who would be the Allteacher, and Sila, who would be mother of Esila.\n\nSayeth Alis, \"We were granted this world by a covenant with high powers, and in that covenant, we yielded our claim to our history. We abandoned what came before, but in doing so, we cast off all our debts. Look forward! Let us explore this infant cosmos, and revel in its glories!\"\n\nAgainst her spoke Owome An, who was of the forty thousand. \"We are alien here,\" said Owome. \"We must climb up our worldline, back to the place from which we came. I call for a vote.\"\n\nSayeth Mara, in secret, \"I think that we came here as safe harbor, and we cannot forever remain. I remember the danger was appalling. I remember we were born in death. I think we must gather ourselves carefully until the time is right.\"\n\nFrom this council, there arose eight verdicts and a ninth.\n\nFirst, that the people were Awoken, and they were immortal.\n\nSecond, that this world was Tributary of another, but that it was forbidden to seek any way to rejoin the mother stream. For this reason, it would be called the Distributary, for that was the proper name for a river that branches from the mother and does not return.\n\nThird, that the Awoken should multiply in wombs of flesh and machine, but only after the most careful forecast of population and ecology, and only under the supervision of those who knew the good technology; for each new child would be immortal.\n\nFourth, that those wise in the good technology should be heralded and heeded, so that the eu-technology could be preserved. They would be eutechs.\n\nFifth, that the women should hold care and protection of the men and the others until more could be born.\n\nSixth, that the purpose of the Awoken should be to know and love the cosmos.\n\nSeventh, that the Awoken were created out of covenant with Light and Darkness, but the covenant was complete, and no further debt would ever be called, except the duty of the Second Verdict to remain on the Distributary.\n\nEighth, that the Awoken were whole in themselves, and they existed in balance.\n\nNinth, that there would be no vote, but instead Alis Li would be recognized as Queen. Her first pronunciation was that there would be no secrets among Awoken.\n\nFor Alis knew of the quiet council around Mara, and although she was neither jealous nor afraid, she remembered it carefully as a spark that might catch."

        "text": "In those days, there was a great birth of adventure among the Awoken. Hunters and pioneers sought the shape of the world, sailors charted the skein of rivers and the perimeter of seas, and astronomers plotted the motion of the crowded heavens. Over this age ruled Queen Alis Li, whose work was the creation of agriculture and the preservation of the eutechnology that she deciphered from the Shipspire.\n\nBut there remained in the forests many tribes of huntresses who preferred their lightfooted freedom-from-comfort-and-duty to the painstaking surplus of the city. Among these tribes, Mara lived with her brother—whose name had returned as Uldren—and with Osana, their mother. It is said that Osana lived as a negotiator and that her son brought her news from other tribes, for he was a scout and hunter of renown. Mara dwelt alone on a mountaintop.\n\nIn the tribes of the forests and the sea, there was the belief that the Awoken had been made out of a friction between contesting forces and that one day this conflict would need to be resolved. These were the Eccaleists who preached that Awoken owed a debt to the cosmos.\n\nIn the cities, however, they lived by the Seventh Verdict under their Queen, and they said the Awoken had been created by cosmic gift and carried neither responsibility nor eschaton. These were the Sanguine, who preached that the Awoken were as stable as an atom of carbon.\n\nNow there arose among the Eccaleists a woman out of the eight hundred ninety one who called herself the Diasyrm. She went into the cities, calling out, \"I accuse the Queen of deicide!\" When she was questioned, she spoke of a foundational crime.\n\n\"Alis Li was the first to awaken in this world,\" the Diasyrm preached. \"She set the terms of our existence. We could have been gods free of want or suffering. Instead, Alis Li chose our mortal form. Our Queen is complicit in all the pain we experience! The Queen murdered all our unborn godheads!\"\n\nAt the thought that the Queen Without Secrets had kept this most appalling secret to herself, the Sanguine cityfolk were deeply troubled. Thus began the Theodicy War."

        "text": "\"It wasn't supposed to be like this,\" Alis Li whispers as, far below the Shipspire, the funeral barges on the Lake of Leaves burst up into magnesium-white fire. The voices of the Paladins rise on summer wind, first choral, then the single keening strains of grief-paeans sung by lovers and close friends. They are singing their lost comrades into death. One of the 891 fell today, shot down by a matter laser, a coherent boson weapon: There was almost nothing left to burn. Matter lasers are the kind of appalling maltech weapon Alis thought she'd locked up in the Shipspire's vaults. She'd armed a few of her Paladins with them, just a few—women she couldn't bear to lose…\n\nThe thought that one might have defected to the Diasyrm breaks her heart.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to go this way,\" Alis repeats. She has not had a confidante in nigh on fifty years: There is no one to whom she can show any doubt. \"I promise you it wasn't.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara says. The eutechs found her and plucked her from her mountaintop with one of the Shipspire's VTOL aircraft, which Alis had, until the war, only ever used as an ambulance.\n\n\"The mission was to carry on the Human journey in a new world.\" Alis paces the wooden deck that clings to the Shipspire airlock, nearly a kilometer above the lake. \"To build a better society, on the principles of equality, knowledge, and peace. I have the charter, Mara. It remembers what I cannot. We were never meant to give up our bodies or shine like stars or—or—\" She groans in frustration and clutches the railing. \"Or whatever it is that the Diasyrm thinks I denied them.\"\n\n\"She thinks you denied them even the capability to imagine godhood.\"\n\nAlis looks sharply back at the other woman. \"Did you start this, Mara?\"\n\n\"Nothing has one beginning,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Did she come to you on your mountaintop and ask you what I did? Did you answer her? Is that why she's so convinced I,\" she swallows against the bitter taste of her enemy's words, \"enslaved her in mere Humanity?\"\n\n\"I didn't have to tell her.\" Mara's white hair stirs in the hot wind. A herd of black horses crosses the northern horizon, all born of Shipspire's wombs: chased by a long-legged huntress and her collie. \"You don't keep enough secrets, your Majesty. The Diasyrm might have opened any one of your texts and read the story you tell. \"We were born when a great ship fell into a pearl of shattered space. I awoke first, and in my awakening I collapsed the potential of the void into a form I understood…\" Who can read that truth and not hear arrogance?\"\n\nAlis thought Mara might say that. Alis also thought Mara might try to push her off the balcony, but she now knows that was a petty fear. Mara is not the Diasyrm: Mara knows the unthinkable value of even a single Awoken life.\n\n\"Why do you love lies so much?\" she asks Mara.\n\n\"Not lies.\" The pale radiance of Mara's eyes; the flush of violet stain around them. \"Secrets. Even if everyone shared a single truth, all our minds would produce different versions of the truth. We speak these subtruths, and like flowers of different seed, the subtruths compete for the light of our attention. In time, only the fiercest and most provocative strains remain. They are not always the truest. Better to keep secrets, your Majesty. Better to tend a great mystery, and so starve the flowers before they can grow. That is how I would be Queen.\"\n\nBelow, the Lake of Leaves shimmers in the crater carved by Shipspire's mushroom prow. One by one, the funeral boats are going out.\n\n\"I want to end this war,\" Alis Li tells the second Awoken. \"I want to negotiate peace. I need your mother's help. What would you ask in exchange?\"\n\nMara smiles graciously and bows her head. \"Nothing but a future boon.\""

An immortal's grief and murder-guilt, left untended, will never fade. Thus it became known to those who fought in the Theodicy War that they had committed an incomparable evil. However, they could not confront their own responsibility, so they rose up in wrath against those who had given them cause, whether by caging them in flesh bodies or by drawing blood over grievance. The war continued by spear and bow, by knife and scalpel, by old machine and new invention. Ever did the Diasyrm's faithful call for the unawaring of Queen Alis Li.\n\nNow there entered into the Diasyrm's camp Osana, mother of Mara, famed for her skill in negotiating contested land. She had come with her son Uldren, who could win a place in any camp for his beauty and for the regal crow-eagle that alighted on his shoulder.\n\n\"I come from Mara,\" said Osana, \"whose heart has frozen in her chest. If you will end the killing, she will tell you any secret that you desire.\"\n\nFor his part, Uldren went among the Diasyrm's warriors and spread ill tidings of Mara's knowledge, saying, \"Mara remembers how the Queen led us here out of chaos and saved us from the twin blindness of darkness and light. Mara knows what the Queen keeps secret. Mara has seen the strife in our souls, the clash from which we were made. We could not ever have been gods with this flaw in us! Rather, we were made from this schism. For as all life is born from energy gradient, as life in the World Before was born from the gradient between hot proton-rich ventwater and cold seawater, we were born of the shadowline at the edge of Light and Dark. We are tremors in that fault. Forever will that schism lead us.\"\n\nHearing this new heresy, the Eccaleists were seized with rapture and scattered to the points of the compass, telling all they met, \"We are the yield of a mighty engine! We could never have been gods! Like diamonds, we were crushed into being. Like diamonds, we hold flaws.\"\n\nMeanwhile Osana spoke to the Diasyrm, who was also heartsick from the killing, and who longed to withdraw from the world and seek transcendence within. \"There is no weregild for the murder of an immortal,\" Osana counseled her. \"You must become a teacher or a midwife and devote yourself to the enrichment of new lives.\"\n\nBut the Diasyrm craved secret knowledge, and she sought Mara upon the mountaintop. Here, she vanished. If she was ever known again, it was not by the name Diasyrm.\n\nWhen there was peace, Queen Li ruled the Awoken for a time; however, the guilt of the war lay heavy upon her, and after an age of peace and progress, she abdicated to a new Queen."

        "text": "A woman lives alone on the forest hills above the Feather Barrens. North of her, in a chaos of ravines and clear but fiercely radioactive streams, the hills surrender to high imperial mountains engaged in brutal seismic warfare, for the Distributary is a young world and has not settled its grudges. To the south are the dry lands where the birds of the forest, especially the parrots, go to die. She lives here because one day she will no longer be immortal, and she wants to observe the dignity of death.\n\nUp these hills comes a man and his mother. The man moves with practiced wariness. But his mother is tired of walking, so she sits down on a giant melon and bellows, \"MARAAA!\"\n\nA fountain of startled birds shoots up into the dawnlight. Not far away, the woman looks up from the broken body of a juvenile gray parrot and softly says, \"Mom?\"\n\nThat night over the fire, after Mara and Osana talk around the oddness of long separation, Mara, tending the pheasants on their spits, says, \"Brother, your eagle killed a parrot today.\"\n\n\"He had to hunt,\" Uldren says, carefully. \"You won't forbid him his last pleasures, will you?\"\n\n\"You've brought him here to die?\" Mara wants to leap up and hug her brother, out of pity and respect. Many of his raptors have died before this one, but Uldren has always been grief-stricken and furious at the waste. Now he's accepted what must happen; he has given his bird the respect of choosing its own place and time to pass.\n\n\"I have,\" Uldren says, looking away. Her pride and respect make him a little verklempt. \"Mother decided she would come along.\"\n\nA shear force as powerful as tectonics has divided Mara's heart. She wants to sit down with her mother and ask her everything, but she is afraid of Osana's insight. \"What brings you to my little camp, Mother?\"\n\n\"Lies,\" Osana says. \"Lies and secrets. And the girl who didn't want to be my daughter, who doesn't know the difference between them.\"\n\n\"I know the difference between a girl and a daughter,\" Mara says, purposefully misunderstanding. The drip pan sizzles beneath golden meat. Her stomach growls. \"Your daughter picks up your baton at the end of the race, and goes on living the life you've taught her. You wouldn't want that, Mother. Because then I'd be all your fault.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Osana sighs, \"but you know what I meant.\"\n\nUldren looks between the two of them, frowning. \"Mom, what's this?\"\n\n\"It's your sister about to admit she's behind it all. Aren't you, Mara?\"\n\nShe unimpales the pheasants from the spits and neatly licks hot grease off her hands. If she spoke, she might scream in terror. What does that mean, behind it all? Does Osana know?\n\n\"The Eccaleists are her creation,\" her mother tells her brother. \"The Diasyrm was her pawn. She allowed the Theodisy War because she was afraid we'd be too comfortable here—also so Queen Alis would need her help politically. Mara couldn't afford to be the most radical dissident. She had to seem moderate for her beliefs to thrive. Isn't that right, Mara?\"\n\nMara puts a hand into the warm soil to keep herself from slumping in relief. Mother doesn't know it all. \"Shall I carve your portions?\" she asks, holding the fractal knife blade-down.\n\nUldren has that look. He knows Mara never answers his questions directly; by evading Osana's, it's as if she's saying that the question is really Uldren's to ask. \"Looks delicious. But Mother does make me curious. Why have you always lived away from the rest of us, Mara? The mountaintop, I understood. You had a brand new night sky to chart. But why now? Why go into the woods like a… a hermit? A heretic?\"\n\nFor the same reason she lived on the hull. For the same reason she can never allow Uldren to really reach her. There is power in remove and safety from the belittling politics of temporal power, which reveal the mighty as unforgivably ordinary and petty. The Awoken have a Queen because a Queen can be a mystery.\n\n\"I remember the day I was born,\" she says. \"Do you, Brother?\"\n\nHe flinches from her eyes. He remembers Yang Liwei and the tether into darkness. He remembers how gravity stretched them into agonized ribbons of flesh. He remembers the truth not even Alis Li may be allowed to know; Mara sees the agonizing moment, the cyclic revelation, when he thinks of her crime, allows it to pierce him like a spit, and buries it deep again.\n\nOsana takes her portion of pheasant meat and rolls it in the bowl of sweet cooked nuts her daughter has prepared. The stars are coming out over the mountains, and the forest birds sing. \"This place is good,\" she says. \"This world. Whatever you remember of our lives before, Mara… I know they cannot have been this good.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But you were both with me. I hope you always will be.\"\n\n\"Always,\" her brother promises.\n\n\"Eat well.\" Mara claps her hands and stands. \"Tomorrow we journey.\"\n\n\"Where?\" her mother asks.\n\n\"I have star charts to share.\" And heresies to tend to. And a new eagle-crow to find for her bereft brother."

These were the Gensym Scribes, who traced their origin to Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, but who were in fact descendants of a band of roving storytellers who traveled across the immense salt glades in a hollering convoy of airboats. Here was their praise of the world:\n\nIt is sweet-watered, and there are no poisons upon it. The temper of the climate is even. Great broad-pawed cats stalk the shallow glades, and brilliant blue flamingos promenade upon the flats. The air is thick and warm, suited for flight, and the wind tastes of forest. No dawn has ever been as glorious as the salt glade dawn, and no dusk has ever moved women to weep as deeply as sunset in the Chriseiads. Corsairs sport upon the open seas, and where they waylay freighters rather than each other, they give rumor and assistance to their prey in proportion to the quality of the chase. Beloved are the stories of young lads and lasses who leap across to the corsair ship for a life of adventure! Beloved also are the terraced farms of the Andalayas, mountains so mighty and so dense with radioactives that they subside year by year into the crust. Most beloved are the fissioneers, who vaulted us to power on a world without petrochemicals. May they forgive the many stories of horror we have told in their memory. May they in particular forgive the lurid stories of the molten lead reactor, and the twelve who were impaled to the ceiling by their control rods, and the Core That Stalked.\n\nIt is the Sanguine Truth that we were granted this world by the unconditional mercy of the powers, and that we will never again know fear.\n\nHowever, the Scribes also recorded their frustration with Mara and Uldren, who alone out of the eight hundred ninety one were said to have seen creation from outside. These two wandered the land gathering lore of portents and prophecies, and all the Eccaleists who remained from ancient days whispered that soon the day of reckoning would be known—the day when the Awoken would be called to repay their debt.\n\nNow in the court of one of the Scribes, there appeared a woman of stellar height and furious wrath, armed with a bow that could be strung only if she twined it around her body and used her whole mass to bend it. \"I am Sjur Eido,\" said the woman, \"and I accuse Mara of the ancient murder of my lady the Diasyrm. In my saddle, I have a weapon with only one death remaining. Take me to Mara, and I will deliver it.\"\n\nThe Scribes consulted and said to each other that this foul murder might prevent another Theodicy War. So they gave Sjur Eido all their knowledge to hunt Mara."

Driven by an AI long ago reduced to basic subroutines, the tender had completed its final mission to wrangle an Oort-cloud comet down into the asteroid belt. When no orders came for the comet's disposition, it had set about gardening. The comet's surface was domed and soiled, and tethered mirrors kept taut by photon pressure focused starlight into a silvery radiance, which fed the oxygen forest well enough. It would have been a marvel of greenery and ancient ice, but the surface had caught fire recently. Oxygen-fueled flame killed nearly everything except insects and rats. But Mara judged it would be a good fixer-upper, the rats the first intelligent life they had met since their return, the insects edible.\n\nThe Hulls had not survived the unpocketing as well as their passengers. The microsingularity wormhole, propped open by a precipitous spike of dark energy, pulled alloy and ceramic armor like taffy. Missiles mauled five of the Hulls. Worst of all, the passage through the nightmare limen between worlds had devastated onboard AI and logic systems.\n\nIt was time to abandon their cocoons. Uldren's survey located a reef of derelict spacecraft, apparently convoyed together for mutual aid in the Asteroid Belt. The Gensym Scribes who'd joined Mara on her journey were even now giddily cataloguing cultural markers and ancient records.\n\n\"We'll salvage the Hulls,\" Mara told Sjur Eido. \"Pull out the raw materials and the systems we can still use, and bring the biosystems of these hulks back online. Once we have reliable gravity, we can start having babies.\"\n\n\"We'll need weapons,\" Sjur said, cheerfully. \"We don't have enough spare chemistry for firearms right now, and the maltech we brought with us would blow right through the hull. Also line-throwing tools and devices for launching satellites off the surfaces of asteroids, hulks, et cetera. You know what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"I cannot say I can imagine,\" Mara said, sarcastically. She imagined the sight of Sjur Eido stringing her woman-tall bow and passed the thought away like a card trick: Dwelling on such pleasantries would not do. \"Will it involve archery?\"\n\n\"Big old compound bows with all sorts of tactical knickknacks.\" Sjur paced in delighted thought. \"I'll be the first woman in the universe to place a comsat in heliocentric orbit with a longbow.\"\n\n\"You're absurd,\" Mara said, and at Sjur's uninhibited grin of delight, at the thought of exploring and rebuilding this entire reef with her, even at the terrible flinch-thrill idea of sending Sjur into violence and danger, Mara felt a tingle of worrisome warmth and gladness.\n\n\"So,\" Sjur said, lunging into that moment of weakness to get what she wanted. \"When will you tell everyone what's happened to Earth?\"\n\nAt first they had thought Earth a ruin world, but there were signs otherwise. At least it had not turned into a machine-gnawed corpse like Mercury. \"When Uldren's back from deploying his drones.\" She narrowed her eyes. \"Sjur, can you hear what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"What, as in telepathically?\" The Queen's bodyguard closed her eyes. \"Everyone's been feeling spooky, but I'm not sure that extends to transmitting—Mara!

Faces appeared to them in the sublimating swirl of cometary ice: images and portraits became impossible to distinguish from their real counterparts. All statues were shrouded, lest they appear to passers-by as corpses.\n\nSomething had changed in them after their return to the outer cosmos. A live-wire hum passed through the tendons in their hands, their jaws popped when they swallowed, and flashes of light like the impact of cosmic rays obscured their vision. It felt to Mara as if they had lowered their feet into an ocean of charge and raised their hand to some invisible cable overhead: as if they were now again in contact with immense and opposing forces that had left an ancient mark.\n\n\"It feels like I've got scurvy,\" Sjur Eido snarled, having never had scurvy in her life. \"As if all these old wounds in my soul are opening up again.\"\n\n\"People keep sending me notes,\" Mara said. Her sensorium had died in the transit, so the notes came to her through whispers and scraps of precious paper. \"They say… I saw your face in my dream. I saw your eyes. I heard your voice.\"\n\n\"So it's not just me.\"\n\nUldren was the second person to bring her revelations on that day. First was Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, one of Mara's most joyful recruits to the expedition: She was a master of pedagogy, able to mold any mind into a shape ready to learn, able to melt any fact into a fluid that could be poured. \"I'm in from the Gensym labs,\" she said, \"and they've learned something wonderful. We're all a bit magic now.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\" Mara poured her a snifter of icy cometary water. \"What does magic mean?\"\n\n\"Some sort of weak acausality.\" Kelda lowered her flowerbulb build into a hammock of tangled plastic. \"They've been firing encoded neutrino beams through volunteers, and it looks as if the resulting patterns of scatter depend on the cognitive and emotional state of the target. It's a very reliable detection, at least four sigma, but the effect size is terribly small.\"\n\nMara digested this with a shot of ancient ice, slushy against her tongue. \"Acausality. You mean that whatever's happening—whatever influence we have on, say, neutrino beams—it's not accounted for by physics?\"\n\n\"Not by any physics we know. At face, it seems to violate some conservation laws, which would make Emmy Noether's head spin.\" Kelda remembers the names of her ancient physicist heroes even when she cannot tell which way is sunward.\n\n\"Secret physics.\" Mara thought of the Traveler and its works. \"We've all felt it, haven't we? We know we're…\" How to say \"trapped in the clinch between light and dark,\" she wondered, without quite so much portent? \"We're in contact with certain numinous elements.\"\n\nKelda held out her cup for more water. \"The question is, your Majesty—\"\n\n\"Don't call me that. We're operating on a direct democracy here.\"\n\nKelda rolled her eyes. \"The question is, do we continue to think of this as science? Do we teach it as physics? Causal closure says that everything that happens in a material system has a material cause. However, if symbolic structures in the mind are triggering material effect… shouldn't we call that what it is?\"\n\n\"Death had no dominion,\" Mara whispered.\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"We're in Death's dominion now. We're all dying again. We were immortal in the Distributary, weren't we? Some part of us was… attuned to the universe. And now that we're no longer receiving the Distributary's signal, we're attuned to something new.\"\n\nThat was when the hatch slammed open and Uldren stumbled in, grinning ferociously, clutching a scummy fistful of cytogel to a slash across his neck.\n\n\"Aliens!\" he rasped. \"I found aliens, and one of them cut my throat!\""

The Fire was built to support habitat construction on 4 Vesta, where Mara hopes to one day anchor the entire flotilla and set down roots—but the hopeful, fearful faces before her make Mara afraid that it'll never happen. What if everyone runs off at the first hint of home? Having come so far, across worlds and eons, to see Earth again—how can she ask them to hold back now?\n\n\"We've found Humanity,\" she tells them. \"We've found our ancestors.\"\n\nThe cheer of triumph and wonder thrills her to the marrow. Most of these Awoken are Distributary-born, raised on myths of Humanity and the Traveler. She has just opened the pages of their storybooks and conjured them to life.\n\n\"What remains of the Human species lives in a single settlement.\" She nods to Uldren, who snaps his fingers for footage. His ship's holographic perspective plunges through fluffy strata of clouds and mist, out into clear air. A lucid vista, a perfect instant: the white mountains, the city, and the enormous shattered sphere that hangs above it.\n\n\"Freeze,\" Uldren commands. \"That is the Traveler.\"\n\nAs the crowd murmurs and thrills, Mara feels herself bridle. She doesn't like that thread of reverence. She doesn't like the Traveler looming there, almost but not quite completely dormant (like a dying heart ripped from its body and thrown into warm water, it ebbs and flutters if you look at it with the right sensors). If the Traveler had the power to protect anyone, wouldn't it protect more than one huddled settlement?\n\nEsila, daughter of Sila, leaps up from the crowd, too small to make it on her own, but buoyed up by enthusiastic neighbors. \"What are we waiting for?\" she calls. \"That's everything we came to find! They need us, and that's where we belong!\"\n\nUldren and Mara trade glances. Uldren snaps his fingers, and the recording resumes.\n\nSomething moves in the treetops. The canopy roils and parts. A red-brown aircraft shaped like a fat, wingless, furiously angry dragonfly bursts from cover and climbs to intercept. Uldren's head-cued camera tracks the target, and Mara imagines his narrow grin as he waits for the other guy to make a move.\n\nThe dragonfly ship drops a brace of little needles, and they erupt into dirty orange flame and come arrowing after Uldren. Everyone in the caucus gets an earful of his grunts as he whips through a high-G turn and climbs away.\n\n\"Those are Fallen,\" Uldren says. \"They're a species of interstellar scavengers and subsistence pirates. They've been here for a long time, and they've sacked most of the large settlements that survived the original fall of Humanity. There may be more Fallen than there are Humans left on Earth.\" He lifts his chin to bare the pale scar across his throat. \"I landed and went looking for prisoners. I was ready when he pulled two knives on me, but it turned out he had an extra set of arms.\"\n\nNervous laughter.\n\n\"Worse,\" Mara adds, beckoning for panes of deep-space passive sensor data, \"they're all over the solar system. We've detected flotillas of their interstellar ships around Jupiter and Venus. They don't go near Mars, but only because it's under occupation by another alien species. Mercury is—well, you can see for yourself.\" Gasps of horror at the clockwork cinder, all that remains of the legendary garden world. \"We believe this may be the work of the Vex, a machine species listed in Shipspire's threat index.\"\n\nEsila, famed historian, puts voice to the plea in the crowd. \"So they need our help, don't they? We have to go to them! Our ships, our technology—we could make all the difference.\"\n\n\"No.\" Mara collapses the projected images between her hands. She stayed up late wrestling with this dilemma, which kept her from wrestling with Sjur. It was a choice she had to make alone. \"We can't reveal our existence, lest the Fallen track us down. We need more information. Our focus must remain on securing this derelict reef, bootstrapping industry and a population, and scouting out the solar system.\"\n\n\"Mara, with all my respect, all my genuine gratitude for bringing us here,\" Esila sighs, \"who died and made you Queen?\"\n\nMara says nothing. But she thinks: Everyone, Esila. All of us died and made me Queen."

        "text": "\"It's bad,\" Sjur Eido says, confirming what Mara already knows, but nonetheless performing the valuable service of mopping away all the blood and tears and allowing Mara to glimpse the actual shape of the wound that divides her people. Not a literal wound (though she is, right now, tending to Uldren's scar, tweezing tiny fragments of Fallen metal out for analysis), but the rift in her Reef, the schism now re-schismatic, as if the quake that split the Distributary Awoken from Mara's people is now firing off aftershocks.\n\nShe should've known this would happen. She shouldn't have told them so much about Earth. \"How bad?\"\n\nSjur pokes Uldren in the hard gut, where a passing line of molten metal left a red burn. He's under anesthesia, but he snarls at her anyway. \"As of the last caucus, I'd say thirty percent of the expedition wants to head for Earth. If you ask the 891,\" though there aren't 891 of them anymore, \"it's more like eighty percent.\"\n\nMara swears and pulls a bloody line of solidified slag from her brother. \"Unacceptable. We can't lose their skills.\" Or their genes: The Awoken have yet to adapt to the attrition of this harsh spaceborne world, and tentative mothers are still in the early stages of designing their babies. It's vital to maintain a diverse gene pool. \"And the Fallen will vector them back to us.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Sjur says, heavily. \"That's when I'm going to die.\"\n\nThe most horrible thing about the words is that they slap down on Mara's consciousness like face-up cards, like truth revealed. \"Unacceptable!\" she barks, and then both she and Sjur begin laughing, and then, at last, Mara shakes her head and growls. \"You can't know that, Sjur. No one can know that.\"\n\n\"I do. I don't know how, but I do. I know it's going to be something I choose to do, and it's going to be incontrovertibly heroic. Which is enough for me.\"\n\n\"But if that's true—\" Mara proposes, flinching away from the personal conversation they really ought to have, and all its attendant rawness, \"—if you die when Fallen attack us, it means I won't stop these people from fleeing to Earth, and the Fallen are going to find us, and we're doomed.\" She is already building intricate models of how the universe might accommodate fate or doom and how she might go about destroying those things.\n\n\"Could be, I suppose.\" Sjur pulls a parchment-thin rag of dead flesh off Uldren's wound. \"Look. I'm the Queen's bodyguard. I always expected I'd die violently.\"\n\n\"I'm not the Queen.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's your problem.\" She flicks Uldren in the chest, leaving a purple bruise, fading. \"What is with you two, anyway? You never talk about him. You never seem to think about him at all. But he's dashing himself to pieces for you. How do live as his favorite and only sister for so many centuries… and hardly even smile at him?\"\n\nSecrets, Mara thinks. You've got to have secrets from each other so there's room for him to fill in the gaps with his own happy illusions. Two ships joined together rigidly will tear each other apart if they try to move. But a loose tether leaves room to maneuver—and can be more quickly disengaged, if necessary.\n\nThat makes her think of Sjur's prophecy again. She sets the shrapnel down in the dissection dish, very gently. \"You won't die. I won't allow it.\""

She keeps low and clutches the breather to her face. All she can think of is Kelda Wadj's last message and the data attached. \"Mara. The paracausal effects are strongest around you. Whatever's happened to us, you are the locus. I cannot overstate how subtle and how important this discovery might be.

Mara has failed.\n\nMara drops onto her belly and pants into the mask. Then, cringing in anticipation of migraine, she activates the augment, the jury-rigged machine her eutechs produced for exactly this purpose by extracting Mara's ruined Distributary implants and reworking them. She's going to fire a command override to shut down that ship's systems—\n\n—but then she realizes it's a salvaged Human vessel, deaf to her commands.\n\nShe gasps in frustration, sucking down cold bottled air. \"Sjur.\"\n\n\"I'm here,\" her radio whispers. \"Pinned down in the dockmaster's office. I shot a few in the shoulders, and they seem to have gotten the idea.\"\n\n\"Let them go. If one ship's away, there's no sense holding back the rest. Our position is compromised.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"Broadcast to everyone. I'm going to allow anyone who wants to leave the Reef to go.

Those who left went to scour the ruins for lost history and give some succor to their Human cousins who still clung to a hostile world. The Awoken came unto these Humans like nephilim, armed with lost weapons, forgotten industry and medicine. They were like omens of hope, for they were often taken to be starborn colonists returned to the hearth, which was not, after all, so far from truth. All who looked on them saw that the night sky contained more than lurking doom. They bred true with each other and sometimes hybridized with Humans, and in the course of centuries, many forgot the Distributary and even the Reef. However, there was always in their souls an itch, a vector pointing to a distant place in the Asteroid Belt, where their Queen still dwelt.\n\n\"They've made a difference already,\" Sjur told Mara not long after the first Awoken made planetfall on Earth. \"They'll save so many lives just with the provision of medicine, pure water, and construction supplies that even if they all died by year's end, they would each yield ten or twenty Humans.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara said, with bitter pride. \"Let the people remember them as saints and paladins, and tell no one how many more they might've saved if they had only kept the faith.\" For she knew the precious value of each Awoken life: She knew how many she would have to spend and mourned each soul wasted on a lesser purpose.\n\nOn the day the Fallen struck, Mara was proclaimed Queen. It happened swiftly, though after no little debate among the people, for everyone was afraid of a monarch who could speak to their thoughts. Yet they feared more to deny her power and sovereignty, for they had come between worlds in her name. To refuse her would be to refuse their choice.\n\n\"Awoken,\" she told them, \"for the first time in my life, I hesitated to reach for power, and now one in three of you are gone. I cannot deny what the cosmos has made of me any longer. I am your one and rightful Queen.\"\n\nShe knew she had been a fool to pretend to be a peer to the others. What was true of her brother was true of all Awoken. They needed secrets to marvel at, secrets that rhymed with the deep enigma of their souls. They could not follow what they fully understood.\n\nThere would be a formal coronation later, in a place not yet built. Out of respect for that unhappened coronation, Mara did not at first wear a crown; and later she claimed as her diadem the ring of event horizon that surrounds the observable universe.\n\n\"My Techeuns,\" she said, gathering Kelda Wadj and the other eutechs who'd remained, \"will be given absolute authority to explore our new power, the Traveler's relics, and all associated domains. We are no longer in the realm of pure science. We require an order of mysteries and witches to tend to them.\"\n\nNot an hour later, a Fallen Ketch threw off its stealth and began a deceleration burn toward 4 Vesta. The four-armed predators had traced one of the Earthward ships back through all its erratic course changes and to the Reef. They came in search of the source of these blue ape-kin.\n\nA salvo of coherent-matter guns gutted the Ketch: blink-quick death for the mighty ship, ancient fury compressing matter into a relativistic pinhead. It was a waste of weapons that couldn't be recharged or reloaded, however, and the Baron in command had already scattered his skiffs like camouflaged seeds. The Fallen Raiders came down all over the Reef and cut their way inside. The Awoken, young to mortality, terrified of death, fled in fear.\n\nMara, Uldren, and Sjur Eido rallied as many as they could. Sjur fought in a powered combat shell, but Mara needed to be seen vulnerable, silver-haired and narrow-eyed, hurling herself at the enemy. She fought with pistol and dagger, and her brother moved like a wraith at her flank. Her people were ashamed of their timidity. No more were the Fallen scuttling alien predators: Now they were an indignity, an offense to regal privilege to be met with a snarl and a rifle shot. The Awoken saw their desperation: how the stump-limbed Dregs stumbled forward emaciated, how the Vandals cringed from battle as they peeled off wall panels, desperate for salvage to please their Captains.\n\nArmored Sjur Eido met the Fallen Baron in zero-gravity combat above his spider tank and shot him dead, one adamant shaft through plate and throat. Ether hissed into vacuum. Sjur threw herself upon the spider tank that clung to the Sacred Fire's hull. Laughing in joy, she cut into the tank's barrel and threw a charge inside, knowing its next vengeful shot would be meant for the Sacred Fire's main habitat drum—and that she would die in the catastrophic misfire.\n\nThe tank fired. The charge detonated. Sjur Eido was thrown clear, utterly unharmed.\n\n\"That was where I should have died,\" she said, in wonder—and in her mind was the smiling face of her Queen."

She had hoped the assault would convince them they had a responsibility to the Reef, to come home and repair the damage they had caused. It went poorly, however, for though her tech witches were able to amplify her bond to her people through the augments Kelda had developed, she was only one voice in a maelstrom. Her Awoken had sensitive antennae, in the metaphysical sense, and could not hear her plea through the clamor. Also, the communications engineer kept forgetting to call Mara \"Majesty\" or \"Queen.\"\n\n\"Good news,\" Uldren told her with the grim delight he always showed after a debacle he had survived. \"Illyn and I went through the Fallen communications logs. Their Baron never transmitted our position to his Kell. He wanted the prize to himself. We remain secure.\"\n\n\"The Baron might have planted a time-delayed beacon,\" Mara warned him. \"Never underestimate these beings. They've lived in the void longer than us.\"\n\n\"I already admire them,\" Uldren confessed. \"They've lost so much. Some of them even ritually dismember themselves, Mara, to prove they have the strength to grow back the missing limbs. I tell you that even if we are doomed to dwindle and go extinct, those Fallen may outlive us.\"\n\nMara made a dry note in her log that her brother had at last discovered his true people.\n\nFor her part, Sjur Eido wandered about in a daze, filled with joy to be alive and grief that she no longer knew the day when she would die. \"In you, all things are possible,\" she told Mara. \"I live because of you.\" When Mara saw her string her mighty bow, the limbs coiled behind her leg and around her opposite arm, she was glad beyond telling that Sjur had survived.\n\nIn time, Mara appointed Paladins to oversee her new military, as Alis Li had done during the Theodicy War. She created talented starfarers as Corsairs, to scour the asteroid belt in utmost secrecy and to establish routes and caches that would support the covert motion of Awoken ships.\n\nMost of all, she charged her brother with the mission that occupied her thoughts. \"Brother,\" she said, \"never again can I allow my people to be divided. We must offer them more than shielding ice and cold habitat cylinders and the warrens of Vesta. We must make a culture, a thread that binds us all in pride and wonder at the mystery of ourselves. Nowhere does culture flourish better than in a city.\"\n\n\"Gather in one place,\" Uldren warned her, \"and you make yourself a target.\"\n\nMara had considered this, and found an answer. \"Go forth and find me a power unknown to all the other powers of this world. Return it to me, and I shall make of it the cornerstone of my new city, where the Awoken shall dream of all they have been and all that is yet to come.\"\n\nSo Uldren went out voyaging among the worlds, swift as a blueshift ghost. In time, he returned to the Reef with a creature not larger than his hand, saying, \"Behold, Sister, the lie that makes itself true. This is an Ahamkara.\""

Blessed are those who in their absolute selfhood become selfless. Unappetizing are those who in their truest self-knowledge exclude the possibility of self-deceit.\n\n\"Mara,\" said Uldren Queensbrother, \"why do you forbid me to speak to the Ahamkara?\"\n\n\"This secret is mine alone,\" said Mara Queen. She knew that her brother had only widened the gap between He-As-Was (which is called NUME) and He-As-He-Would-Be (which is named CAUST). \"Begone to the outer world, where I require thee.\"\n\nThis was when Sjur Eido, having spoken to Kelda Wadj and to Esila, at last came before her Queen. Kneeling, she said, \"Your Majesty, Kelda Wadj says you are a god, for there is no difference between your desire and reality. Yet I know that you desire things before they ever become real. Esila says that you are keeping a secret from your brother that he must never know. I think the secret is thus: You are now a god because one day you will become a god, and a god is not temporal. Your brother is not a god because he will never become a god. Shall I worship you?\"\n\n\"Sjur,\" Mara said, falling to her knees, clutching her beloved's face between shaking hands, \"Sjur, on the day you worship me, you cannot love me anymore, for to worship is to yield all power, and I cannot love what has no power over me.\"\n\nAt this, the Ahamkara coiled around her neck, yawned, and showed its fangs: for there was a crevice between What Was and What Was Wanted.\n\n\"I see,\" Sjur Eido said. \"Then to me you are not yet a god.\"\n\nAlthough in time the knowledge of what Mara would become pushed them apart, it was a kind and happy push, as a friend might urge a beloved companion onward to a distant opportunity.

I dreamt of Death bearing this blade, or of something so closely allied with Death as to be its synonym, so that to separate them would require a knife sharper than sharpness. Death raised up that blade and said \"I cut all and all I cut. Aiat.\"\n\nThen Death cut the bomb, and the bomb was broken and could not fire. I was in the bomb. I knew that Death was the cut-verb, and that its only verb was to cut.\n\nSHAPES AND GLIDERS. I dreamt of existence as a game of cellular automata. In this metaphor, there were only two things: shapes in the game world and the rules of the game world. The rules were the rules of Life and Death. I understood that the sword was the desire to escape existence as a shape in the game and to become the rule that made the shapes. This rule said only \"live\" or \"die\"—it had no other outputs. It could not keep secrets. Against it was the desire to become a shape so complex that it could within itself play other games.\n\nWHAT WILL SOON BE. I dreamt that the Sword that was Death and Rule sought out complexity and cut it to reveal the simplicity within. I knew that soon we would be cut for we were complex and full of secrets. I knew that it was coming. I knew that the stroke would fall and that I had to stop it.\n\nHOW CAN A BOMB MAKE USE OF A SWORD?\n\nHOW CAN THE RULE THAT SEPARATES LIFE FROM DEATH BE KILLED?\n\n\"I must go to the Dreaming City and use the oracle engine,\" Mara told her Techeuns. \"Prepare my ship.\""

A mother who had remained behind; a sister with secrets; a brother who hunted and explored; a woman who was plain and fierce. She understood then that the answer to her question lay within herself and that to defeat what was coming, she would need a perfect understanding of herself. Isolation would be her watchword, for an isolated system is easiest of all to understand.\n\nFirst of all, Mara went into the gardens and planted a flower for her mother, who she thought must still live: though she might by now have forgotten her first daughter and her first son.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"I asked to be your sister rather than your daughter, and so I denied you the chance to tell me your secret, the mothertruth that is mapped in the negative space defined by the lies mothers tell their daughters.

She knelt in grief and touched her hand to the floor where his pacing boots had scuffed the asteroid stone smooth. This was the shape of their siblinghood now. The pursuit of absences.\n\nLast of all Mara went to Sjur Eido. Sjur was making a list of incredibly stupid and fatal tasks to post on a Guardian bounty board. \"I want to tell you the truth,\" Mara said. \"Ask me a question.\"\n\n\"If you take any positive integer and halve it if it's even, but triple it and add one if it's odd, and you repeat this process forever, will you always, eventually, reach one?\" Sjur Eido demanded.\n\n\"Sjur, my faithful Wrath,\" Mara said, \"please take my openness seriously.

I guess I don't see what else you could've done, if you cared about those we left behind. If you wanted us to be able to go back and help in the fight.\" She leans forward and very gently kisses the inside of her helmet, where it meets Mara's: in her mind, in that place that is bound to all other Awoken, Mara feels the touch of gentle lips.\n\nSjur looks suddenly sly. \"You know, Mara, I don't think you could've confessed anything, anything at all, unless it were a way of keeping a deeper secret. What's really going on?\"\n\n\"There are many ways to godhood,\" Mara tells her. The belt of Orion glitters on her helmet like a three-star rating left by some Hive entity Sjur once killed. \"One way is to kill all that is killable, so all that remains must be immortal. Another is the road I have walked, mostly by accident. One of these ways is closer to the sword, and one is closer to the bomb.

Oryx's throne world smashes through her fleet, the bubble of everted screamspace pulverizing rock, metal, and flesh as mere matter surrenders to the will-made-fact of the Taken King. Somewhere, Uldren roars defiance. This is the moment of absolute sacrifice, the incarnation of Awoken doom: to give up their lives in defense of the world they once abandoned. The sense of their great dying rips at Mara like a sob.\n\nShe feels her Techeuns preparing emergency selfgates. Shuro Chi reaches out to her—a wordless, urgent need for Mara to live—and it takes all the cold impassive remove of Mara's millennia to turn that hand away.\n\nThe shockwave strikes.\n\nMara dies.\n\nIn one way, she is vaporized with her Ketch, the bonds between the very particles of her body questioned by the harrowing logic of Oryx's weapon and found inessential. The mechanism of devastation is spontaneous fission. The author of the devastation is laughing in joy.\n\nIn another way, a more true and symbolic way, she is impaled on Oryx's blade. She has thrown all her might at him, and he has answered. He has snuffed her fledgling divinity and her meager claim to royalty, he has exposed Mara to the raw and caustic hostility of his High War. She has been defeated by the sword logic.\n\nShe dances down the blade and steps into his throne world. The Harbingers give her the gate and she takes the step. She is dead, consumed by Oryx: She is dead in his will, his Ascendant Realm. There was no other way inside except this true way.\n\nInanna at least gave her people some warning; she told her minister to have her worshippers lament, drum, pray, and lacerate their buttocks. Inanna told her minister to beg the gods to save her. Mara has not. Instead, she has enlisted Eris and several million mad dancing Guardians to go knock off the god who killed her. It is, on that level, a very simple bank heist: Get yourself taken into the treasury as treasure, and when the owner dies, break back out with his stuff.\n\nBut even Inanna had to send everyone away before she passed through the last door.\n\nMara thinks of everyone she has ever known, all the people she has lost, back even to Yang Liwei and that ray of Light in deepest Darkness. She is there again, on the tether, falling into the mystery. Her brother is crying out after her, trying to follow, and she cannot look back.\n\nShe has been thinking of a logic of her own, of secrets and hidden designs. The universe has not grown simpler in its age. Wherever life can begin, it has begun, and even in some places where sensible folk expect it should not. The great tendency has been toward intricacy, toward sophistication, toward deep thought and richer ways of being. A sword is everywhere edged, but the pieces of a bomb do not look at all like weapons until they are assembled.\n\nOryx's throne world tries to tear her body and psyche into a quintillion screaming pieces, but Mara has survived the inchoate primordial chaos before space and time. She has retained her selfhood through far worse than this—and she has patience for eons. Eris will succeed. The Guardians will play their part. When the power in this world is free for the taking, Mara will take it, not as the victor taking spoils, but as a scavenger takes a prize component for her masterwork.\n\nWhen a pawn reaches the far side of the chessboard, it may be promoted to a queen. And what hatches when you promote a queen? What new board does she claim her place on?\n\nMara knows.\n\nShe settles in for the long wait, entirely alone, almost at peace with it."

All she'd ever wanted was to serve and protect Mara, and now Mara Sov was—\n\nMara Sov was…\n\nMara was alive; she was alive somewhere. She'd promised!\n\nRetaking the yoke of her own Galliot, Petra sets a course for the Tangled Shore. She cycles through comms channels as she flies: The Hive are swarming the Outpost, and the Disciples are demanding escort in their evac. Devi is MIA. Guardian jumpship after Guardian jumpship is throwing itself at that monstrous Hive ship, only to be repelled by some kind of defense field. A hundred Seeders are landing on Ceres. Hallam is evacuating every civilian he can to the shielded inner cities. Two hundred more Seeders on Pallas. Skyburner forces inbound, armed to the teeth. Wolf allies defecting. Devi is found.\n\nPetra cannot turn off the radio. She cannot stop listening; she can scarcely breathe. She wants to reverse course and fly her ship into the eye of that flagship; she wants to wreck herself against its ugly scrimshawed hull and scream so clear and true as she dies that that wretched beast will hear her and know what atrocity he has committed. She wants to believe Mara is alive but how, how, how when she cannot feel her, when she does not know every step of the accursed plan!\n\nShe approaches Thieves' Landing from a reckless angle, then cuts fast and low across the lashed-together wreckage of the Shore. The air is thick with dust and debris and shimmering immaterial Harbinger matter; it is impossible to see more than a klick out. She follows her radar.\n\nUnconsciously, she holds her breath.\n\nAnd then—there it is. The Watchtower.\n\nPetra sighs through clenched teeth.\n\nIt's whole. Unharmed."

Not very long ago, Processes and Services was the place Illyn and her sisters came to make the Desolates—items of technology imbued with the husk-dry power of Oryx's Taken. Illyn was the first to stand as living conduit; the first of the Techeuns to use that deep interior faultline, that fundamental Awoken schism, as a bridge. She remembers the endless, awful, infinitely malicious screams of the things. But she also remembers the whispers… and if the screams are silent now, the whispers are louder than ever.\n\n\"Quickly,\" Illyn hisses. \"Before Petra is informed.\" Any breach of Processes and Services triggers an alert, and while they were crafty in their intrusion, even minute body heat and motion of the air will be detected. \"We must ask our questions and go.\"\n\nBrave Portia leads them to the cell she selected for their use—a vacuum-gapped sphere of relic iron coated inside and out by signal-deadening spinfoil. It hovers in suspension, a black miniature Traveler, a pearl formed around a hideous interior flaw. Illyn opens a needle-thin access port. The stink of ozone rolls out.\n\nThere is a Taken Vandal within, flexing and shuddering through nameless permutations of blissful agony.\n\n\"Nascia,\" she whispers. Quiet, precise Nascia slips a whisker of cable into the port, guiding it through impossible twists and encrypted locks with the caress of her augments' fields.\n\nIllyn rubs her temples. The whispers are loud here. The whispers that haunt the place where their Queen's voice once sounded. Whispers which sound so much like missing Shuro Chi and the others from the Queen's flagship.\n\nThey should have selfgated to the Dreaming City if the battle went wrong. They should have come home safe. What if they need help? What if Petra has kept their fate from Illyn? Would she do that, Petra Covensdaughter, raised by the witches? Things have not been easy between the Regent-Commander and the Techeuns…\n\n\"Ready.\" Nascia offers the splayed end of the cable to them. \"Be careful, all of you.\"\n\nTheir augments sync in a stutter of light, like a sunbeam passing over a field of diamonds. Inquisitive Lissyl forms the first question. Do you hear us?\n\nThe viper-strike rush of the Taken thing's will comes at them. It is powerful, but familiar: Illyn deflects its demand. \"I think it hears us,\" she says, with a grim chuckle. \"We know Taken too well, don't we?\" There were fears once that the Guardians would be appalled by the Taken-empowered armor. But Petra was right. Guardians will wear anything that gives them power—whether tactical or social.\n\nTogether, they unfold the Taken thing's brutally elegant interior geometries, seeking the threads of connection that reach out across space and time. \"Shuro?\" Illyn whispers. \"We have heard you. Do you hear us?\"\n\nThat is when she makes the fatal mistake. She thinks of the time before Saturn. She thinks of Shuro Chi and Uldren and Mara. She… wants that time back.\n\nShe wants.\n\nIn the nonspace around them, great jaws snap shut.\n\n\"RIVEN!\" brave Portia screams. Illyn was prepared for Taken—folded perfect things, elegant and thus manageable—but this absolute appetite, this impossible will…\n\nShe speaks the secret word of stasis that will crash their augments and end the communion. She does not know if she is in time. Quiet Nascia is screaming, inquisitive Lissyl is screaming. The screaming has begun again."

At last!\" He has gone out in a cloak and a rebreather to dance in joy.\n\nWhite light flashes through the film of Koro's plastic hovel. Tellia thinks of arc grenades and the Baron's Scorn cutting through the walls of her lab. She shudders, counts the arrows in her quiver, and tries to go back to sleep.\n\nShe can't. She puts on bow and quiver, joins Koro outside. He's sifting the lightning-struck earth, grinning like a fool. A burrowing insect slips between his fingers—he pinches after it, but gets only one slim antenna. \"I need nitrogen to grow plants,\" he explains, pointing up to the sky and the mist of contained air that surrounds this part of the Reef. \"When the containment field builds up enough charge, it arcs to the ground, and the lightning bolts split nitrogen in the air, which fertilizes the soil. Isn't that amazing?\"\n\nTellia stares at him. \"You can't seriously want to farm here.\" Home, civilized proper home, is a sealed habitat—a cool clean place full of light.\n\n\"Why not? We're a refugee people now, Tellia. You think things are going to get better?\" He points to the bright stars of habitats and ships above. \"All those—those are targets. We have to learn to live off our land.\"\n\n\"We're a refugee people because things keep killing us!\" Tellia leaves angry bootprints in the soil. \"You won't have to be out be here long.

It took legions of Guardians to kill Oryx. The Queen, she's… I know she was something special. But she's no Guardian.\"\n\n\"I think I can still feel her,\" Tellia says, stubbornly. \"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Who knows what can get into our heads these days.\"\n\nA new star ignites overhead. Koro squints. \"Guardian ship,\" he says. \"You can tell by the way they come in, like they just don't have a care.\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll come hunt the Scorn.\" Maybe one day Tellia will be a scientist again, in a proper lab, with a proper place to sleep. \"Like the days after Skolas…\"\n\n\"I've got other hopes.\" Koro slaps his thighs, bounds to his feet, and, as if he is a true prophet, heads for his hovel just a moment before his baby bursts out crying. \"You hear about that one Fallen on Hygeia? He pays for people willing to maintain a few remote telescopes.\"\n\n\"You work for the Spider?\" Tellia cries. \"But he's—\"\n\n\"Willing to pay in hard goods. Willing to help people move. Even willing to provide security.\" Koro pulls back his hovel's flap. \"Want to help me with the kids? Someone's got to explain why they shouldn't be afraid of lightning.\""

        "text": "Petra has her welcome for Zavala all planned out. He will say something stentorian which, while it is technically a greeting, Petra will also read as reproach, or condescension, or perhaps paternal concern. Petra will smirk at Zavala like she really doesn't care, so that he knows he's nobody, a little guy, a bureaucrat, far beneath her anger. But at this exact moment, a shard of cyanide-laced ice from the far reaches of the Oort cloud will penetrate the Reef's ravaged defenses and smash into Zavala with such velocity that he becomes a thin ooze across the floor, a scum. When Zavala's Ghost begins to rebuild him, Petra will say, smoothly, \"No, allow me!\" Then she will brandish a mop.\n\nThe hatch opens. Cayde-6 backs his way through, talking to Zavala: \"Whatever you've seen, whatever you've read, it's worse. These people need our—\"\n\n\"Cayde.\" Petra half-consciously adopts Mara's fey remove, her insouciant and remote posture. Her throat jams up, and she actually coughs aloud against the sudden grief. \"You brought—\"\n\nZavala grinds his way into the room, an obelisk of City stone extruded across the solar system to invade Petra's space. He very politely answers Cayde before turning to her. \"The fact is, Cayde, the Queen did us a favor by leaving the Reef in chaos. As long as the Fallen are here killing each other, we have room to rebuild.\" Now he nods to Petra. \"Regent-Commander. Pleased to see you well.\"\n\n\"Likewise, I'm sure.\" Petra feels in her heart that the Queen saw the Reef as a protector of Earth and its people, if perhaps not protector of the Traveler. It still kills her to hear Zavala speak openly of the Reef as a distraction. \"Cayde had a proposal,\" she says, \"that he wanted us both to hear.\"\n\n\"Yes I did!\" Cayde prances between them, like a flare meant to draw off the heat-seeking fury passing between Petra and Zavala. The City's fall drove him deep into his jester persona, devil-may-care and fancy free; he hasn't quite recovered. \"It's like this, Petra. We're bringing a lot of Earth's lonely people into the arms of the City. I got to talking to Variks about the situation out here, and I figured hey, maybe it's time we extend that policy to you.\" He sobers. \"I want to invite the Reef Awoken into the City. Abandon this place to Variks, to Dead Orbit, to whoever wants it. It's hell out here, Petra. You won't survive.\"\n\nZavala's eyes are locked on Petra. He burns with a magnificent, stentorian power. \"Does the Regent-Commander have enough control over the Reef to execute a withdrawal?\"\n\n\"Despite your best efforts,\" Petra snaps—and then, suddenly, she cannot stop. She is too furious, too hot with grief. \"At least Cayde is honorable enough to acknowledge what you've done to us. Every Fallen House you shatter washes up on our shores! Every Hive god and Cabal tyrant you attract goes through us to get to you! No wonder she couldn't stand the sight of you, Zavala. You've forsaken your people.\"\n\nShe bites back the rest: how she wishes that back in two-thousand-and-whatever, when the Darkness hurled mankind off the height of its Golden Age to plummet sixteen centuries into barbarism, it had done just a slightly better job.\n\nThat's not true. That's her broken heart talking. But oh does it talk loud.\n\n\"She was a charlatan,\" Zavala says, quietly. \"Fighting a war that existed only in her mind. Dragging you all behind her. Any of you who will admit that are welcome in my City. But I will not take in whatever conspiracies she left unfinished. If you come to us, you come to join the City.\"\n\nNo. No. Stop being the Queen's people? Stop remembering her promise? \"You're afraid,\" Petra tells the Titan of Titans. \"That's why she could never trust you. Go back to your Traveler, Zavala. Thank you for your concern, Cayde, but the Reef has its own purposes, and you would mourn your foolishness if we abandoned them.\"\n\n\"Petra—\"\n\n\"They are the purposes,\" she snarls, \"intended by our Queen.\""

She got her wish. Perhaps she regrets it. She was right about one thing, at least… this is where everything that matters happens. If Dead Orbit had ruled the City, there would've been a fleet to meet Ghaul.\n\n\"It's Arach Jalaal of Dead Orbit,\" he says, cheerfully. \"I'm here to speak to Regent-Commander Petra Venj. I am not an emissary from the City. I come on my own accord to discuss matters of fleet.\"\n\nJalaal has been to the Reef before, but never through proper channels. He's a little surprised when Petra Venj meets him at his transmat zone; he expected an escort to a waiting area, where he'd be given a sense he's not a priority. However, Petra is an operative, not a politician. She can't bear to delay action for the sake of theater. He likes that.\n\n\"Arach Jalaal.\" She shakes his hand firmly. Does he feel a whisper of some faint telekinetic force against his throat? She can do that knife trick… and what else? \"Welcome back to your ancestors' home.\"\n\n\"Regent-Commander. How does the role suit you?\" A reminder that they are both out of place.\n\n\"It's temporary.\" She beckons him to walk. \"You want to discuss ships. We have talented labor, but no safe yards for them to do their work. If you can supply a site—\"\n\nHe checks her with a slash of his hand, a spacewalker's gesture. \"I came for salvage rights.\"\n\n\"Salvage?\"\n\n\"Around Saturn. I want your permission to go through the debris swarm for materials and spaceframes. The dead will, of course, be returned.\"\n\nPetra is silent. Arach expects her, being a spacer, to be a pragmatist; to see that the Reef doesn't have the spare capacity to process this salvage and that the inner Solar System needs as many ships as it can raise. There is also the question of Oryx's weapon and whether it can be defeated if the Dreadnaught ever stirs again.\n\nBut Petra remains silent.\n\n\"The wounds are still too fresh? I apologize. It seems a shame to leave those resources for the Fallen, or to drift into Saturn…\"\n\nShe speaks. \"Earthborn. Did you mourn for her?\"\n\nHe thinks she will know if he lies. \"I respected her, yes, but I despised the way she seemed… entitled… to us all. I never regret choosing the path I did. I was Awoken to continue the search we started long ago. The quest for worlds worthy of our lives.\"\n\nPetra turns her back and goes.\n\nHe stares after her. Only after a long minute does he understand: She cannot say any of the things she wants to say and cannot bring herself to tell the lies she should. So she refuses him. She refuses the choice.\n\nJalaal pities her a little. She will never be free of her."

All of this scholarship would benefit from cross-reference and critical comparison with your own collected records.

There's a big coiled ammonite fossil right under the thin topsoil, though, and he knocks his forehead on it. The pain and the blowing sulfur dust make him sneeze.\n\n\"Humbly I come,\" he says, almost laughing, \"to speak to thee.\" Ikora said this was the place. Io. A world still half-born, connected as if by an untorn umbilical to the Traveler. \"I wanted to say… thank you.\"\n\nHe finds he's looking up at Jupiter. He's accustomed to seeing the Traveler above the City, so he fastens on the nearest huge floating sphere as a proxy. He forces his eyes down to the soil again. \"Thank you for what you did to Ghaul.\"\n\nIkora tells him if you listen with the right ears, you can hear the Traveler's last conversation with Io. As if the matter of terraforming an entire moon with Earthlike gravity and a biosphere is only a matter of rhetoric and instruction. Well. Isn't that the challenge, in the end? Not just assembling the power to do something, but convincing people to do it? No, not even that—not convincing or coercing (Traveler knows he is tempted sometimes), but teaching them how to think as you think, how to value what you value, even giving them the ethics required to understand your valuation. So that you can trust them to make the choices you would, even when you're not around to father them.\n\nZavala wishes he were half as good a teacher as he is a Titan. Then maybe he could allow himself to relax a little and let others take care of things.\n\nExcept last time he let his guard down—last time he dared think they were triumphant, with Oryx repelled, SIVA contained, Vex befuddled, Cabal huddled in their bunkers and too stubborn to come out—Ghaul turned up in a storm and nearly destroyed the City, the Traveler, and everything Zavala loves.\n\n\"Did I fail you?\" he asks the bone-coiled dirt. \"Am I… the reason you had to wake up? Because I couldn't stop Ghaul by myself?\"\n\nIn the giddiness of victory, he declared this their new Golden Age. But now he thinks he may have misunderstood the Traveler's awakening. He has always, he hopes, been a brave man. But he is almost too afraid to ask this next question. \"Is this just our next 'age of triumph'? Is something worse on the way?\"\n\nThe bruise where he head-butted the fossil throbs. History, Zavala once told someone, is a question of armor. How much can you survive and keep on living? More than this, more than what's hit them so far.\n\nBut how much more? And if the next escalation is a consequence of the Traveler's awakening, will it be Zavala's fault?\n\nDuty is a puzzle. The harder you work, the more it seems to weigh. That reminds Zavala of Basho, his favorite poet, and of the hot spring Basho once visited to see the Murder Stone, which killed birds and insects that came too near. He has a horrible idea of the Traveler as that stone, surrounded by buzzing flies all shaped like Ghosts…\n\n\"You're doing it again,\" his Ghost warns him. \"I know that expression.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Zavala says. \"I just worry.\""

        "text": "As I have made it my life's work to seek as much truth as history can offer, I chronicle these dreams in hope that my subjective understanding might provide some path to truth for others:\n\nINFINITE SADNESS: I stand at the bow of a ship, crying as the stars streak the skies. I am trying to chronicle trillions of star systems at once, searching for a single planet. A faceless companion asks why I look so sad, and I show her a photo of a globular mass or a dual-ringed planet, depending on how you hold it. \"How much did you pay for that?\" she asks. \"Everything I have,\" I respond. Then the stars stop streaking and the ship crumbles apart. We fall into nothing, and I awake.\n\nFISSURING WARMTH: I am running from an encroaching burn of blue light. I jump from rock to rock, as they are the only things with gravity. Every leap is a battle against the cold nothingness of space. I see a sea of people gathered together, and realize that's where I am trying to go. I make one more giant leap, but the blue burn catches my ankles, and I fall. The impact of my plummet shatters the rock in two. Hundreds of these beings fall into the chasm I created behind me. I try to heave each of them back to the surface, and I do until I can't anymore. My elbows won't bend; my arms are too weak to push. The descent gets warmer and warmer until all goes black, and I awake.\n\nSONGS OF ANALYSIS: I am outside my body watching it float from one shapeless void into another. The first void contains a voice humming a tune, yet no presence. As I pass through each, one by one, another voice joins in harmony. I try counting the voices, but I am not sure if I should be adding or subtracting as they fade into one, and in my confusion I lose any memory of numbers at all. I feel a tether pulling me back into being and see myself waving goodbye. A voice burrows into my mind as the serenading songs become discordant, ugly. The voice becomes louder, and I awake.\n\nWASHING SKIN: I have gathered my belongings in a gray porcelain sink. The soap clings to my fingers. As I wash what I possess, my things begin to dissolve. I scrub harder because I know that the washing is a way to remove impurity, and I must be certain that I will not dissolve too. My mother tells me that silver is the element of false-life, blue skin poison. I worry that my fingernails are soft.\n\nMOUNTAIN: I am on the mountain at Felwinter's Peak, except there is an express monorail to my neighborhood grocery in the City, which is all out of what I need. A Guardian brings me a special engram. I refuse to decrypt it. I tell the Guardian it is better this way, unactualized, secret, certainly containing the thing that will be needed when the moment comes.\n\nTYRA: I am someone else. I hope that someday I will meet Tyra Karn."

        "text": "Dinna twists the emergency transponder until the circuit closes. And for the second time in her life, she feels the crackle of the beacon as it burns itself out, blasting its life into a single radio howl: PSARA PSARA PSARA\n\nIt means that the Queen's throne room is about to fall.\n\n\"Done,\" she tells her second. \"Let's not count on reinforcements.\"\n\n\"Not our reinforcements, at least.\" Pods are still coming in from the prison, crashing all over the Vestian Outpost. \"The throne isn't a tactical target. Do you think they'll bypass us?\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Dinna says, grimly. \"Not the littlest chance.\"\n\nThe Queen's Guard has, technically, never been defeated in battle: Pride dismisses the House of Wolves' backstab as an act of treachery, not military might. But once more the Fallen are loose in the Reef… and if there is no treachery involved, Dinna will eat dirt and call it hummus. This reminds her too much of that awful day.\n\nSo when the voice comes through the door, she calls, \"Hold. Hold.\"\n\n\"Paladin Dinna?\" the Prince of the Awoken calls. \"You know that's my throne you're guarding, don't you? May I come in?\"\n\n\"You're not alone,\" she shouts back.\n\n\"I have my retinue with me.\"\n\nA few of Dinna's people lower their weapons. \"Weapons up,\" she snaps. \"We can't trust him to—\"\n\nRoyal overrides slither through the throne room's networks. The doors open, and a dazzling barrage of flashbangs plays the royal welcome. Dinna stares straight into it, weapon aimed, eyes open, trusting her helmet to buffer her sight—and waiting for the first blue flash of Fallen weapons.\n\nPrince Uldren Sov saunters in like the belle of the ball, his cocked revolver aimed at the ceiling. \"At ease,\" he says, with a little swish of his cloak, and everyone, Dinna included, responds. Just a moment's weakness. Just the subtlest flicker of deference, because he is the Prince and it feels so right to have royalty in this throne room again. Fingers off triggers, weapons skewed a few degrees off target—\n\nThe impulse is so strong because it jives with Dinna's discipline, which has already stepped in to crush the immediate instinct to blow Uldren away. Something's wrong. Something's off.\n\nBaseline Humans can react to a visual stimulus in less than two hundred milliseconds. Awoken, less than a hundred. But there is a phenomenon Dinna and every other Royal Guard knows well, a trick of the mind called attentional blink. You are waiting for something to appear: a hostile, a gunshot, a loud noise. When it does appear, your attention blinks. You cannot detect a second event if it comes just after the first.\n\nSo it is with the blue flash of Arc-rifle fire behind Uldren's cloak.\n\nIt could go differently, still. But there is no one in this room who can easily sight in and fire on their Prince—and he has no such reciprocal inhibition."

        "text": "Entry 10\n\nI'm a mother to a beautiful daughter. A daughter who talks to people who aren't actually there. Normal kid stuff, sure. Reminds me of my own childhood.\n\nLike when my mother would tell me ghost stories. They fascinated me. Especially the really creepy ones where ghosts would try to communicate with people.\n\nI decided I was going to be the first person to truly make contact with one. Headed to the creepiest part of my house, the basement. I was going to just sit in the dark and wait until something, anything showed up. But, my plan was cut short. Took one hell of a tumble down the basement stairs. Many bruises and a broken arm later, my mother reminded me that ghosts weren't real. That I should stick to what I could see in front of me.\n\nBut sometimes you just want to believe in a thing, you know? Because what if it is real? What if this big beautiful universe we barely know is much stranger and more complicated than any of us realize?\n\nShouldn't we want to look beyond what we can see with our eyes?\n\nI mean—a gigantic ominous ball floats in the sky over other planets and terraforms them. Stranger things haven't happened. If something like the Traveler exists, doesn't it stand to reason that there's more out there we don't know?\n\nSo many people treat the Traveler like it's not this completely alien thing that we still know nearly nothing about. Sure, we've benefitted from it immensely. But so many people around the world put their blind trust in it. Their faith, even. To a fault. A huge one.\n\nWe've let ourselves become hypnotized by the Traveler into thinking we're all safe. We've let ourselves become naïve about the world around us. We've let our guard down on a personal level. All in the name of achieving world peace and all—we claim—because the Traveler inspired us to do so.\n\nWe're comfortable. Complacent. Unprepared for the next time fate tells to wash us all away. And make no mistake, it will.\n\nMy daughter's not old enough yet to comprehend the Traveler. But she is impressionable enough to become weakened by it like the rest of society, should I let her.\n\nI will not let her."

I'm lucky to have friends in informative places who tell me these things.\n\nThey don't know what it is. But there is something. Could be another Traveler. Could just be a wonky radio wave. Or could be something really bad.\n\nOn the off chance it IS something to be concerned about, shouldn't we be prepared to deal with it head-on before it arrives?\n\nBut how are we supposed to do that when the means to defend ourselves are not in the people's hands anymore? Don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't understand those decisions. They make sense, but…\n\nHaving a child changes your perspective on life. I won't feel comfortable unless I am the one doing something to protect my family. I can't be the only one.\n\nNo more sitting around thinking someone or something else will do it for us. I will handle it.\n\nAnd I won't do it alone. I know just the right people who would appreciate the opportunity to be a part of something like this.\n\nSomething that the \"powers that be\" would never sanction. But like I've said in the past, we don't know what else is out there in the universe. What we, or our children, or our children's children might have to face one day.\n\nWe will be prepared."

We have to champion all that we hold dear. Who we are: our values, our cultures… all that we believe in as human beings. This is why we founded the Black Armory.\n\nOur works. They're beautiful. All of them. Finely crafted. Made from the strongest of materials. Durable, accurate.\n\nIt took me some time to create our first few designs, but I wanted to get them right. Make them distinct, to reflect who we are. Mothers. Fathers. Sons. Daughters. Friends. Lovers.\n\nIf the day comes that we need to wield these weapons against—I don't even know what—they'll be there to remind us what we are fighting for, what we are defending. Where we come from.\n\nI am so lucky to have found Helga and Yuki, my co-founders, who share these feelings so deeply.\n\nThe Black Armory owes its continued success to them. I am in awe. Helga's formerly from Clovis Bray. She handles the business side of things. Yuki's our resident engineer. Handles the science and mechanics of it all.\n\nEvery day I get to admire these women and everything they do right. They put so much of themselves into our work. Their soul, their heritage.

For the Black Armory.\n\nI should be thrilled. \"Should\" being the key word here.\n\nBut I didn't ask to build a mobile weapon factory. I didn't come up with the idea. Helga and Yuki did. Suffice it to say, lately we haven't been agreeing on things as much as we used to.\n\nWith the \"anomaly,\" they believe now more than ever that we need our work out there. Easily accessible in the moment, they said. In much greater number, they said.\n\nWe're growing fast. Too fast. Which means mass production. Which in turn means less control over our work. How it's distributed, who it's distributed to, etc. It means more weapons to defend ourselves, yes, but not in every single person's hands. That was not my vision. Power without control leads to chaos. It's a give and take.\n\nAnd nothing says less control quite like placing portable weapon printers all around the world. Hell, they're even discussing putting them on other planets.\n\nI guess I always thought this operation would stay more intimate, more focused.\n\nI know that Helga and Yuki are just looking out for the Armory's best interests. Helga's always reminding us—obnoxiously might I add—that until the little green aliens invade, this is as much a business as a cause.\n\nSo I signed off on it.\n\nHelga can keep being the semi-cruel one around here.

They're nothing but the experiments of Humans playing God. Since when has that gone well? If one day they decide they don't like the rest of us, what recourse do we have? It'll be slaughter.\n\nThinking about combining that technology with ours makes me sick.\n\nHelga knew how I would feel about this. She absolutely knew. And yet she brought it to me anyway. She even brought up Titan again! They're talking about a potential evacuation. \"People will need protection more than ever,\" she said. \"This is the logical next step.\"\n\nYuki tried to play both sides as usual. She means well. Always getting between me and Helga when things start to get ugly.

Butterflies start as so much less and make themselves something more.\n\nPerhaps if either of us had any tears, we would have cried.\n\n---\n\nEntry 143\n\nI thought I saw one of those small drones pass over us today. We were picking berries and watching out for more butterflies when I thought I caught a glimpse of the damned thing.\n\nI made her promise: No matter what happens, if they catch you, you must not trust them—not ever.\n\n---\n\nEntry 144\n\nThese are difficult days and nights. It's slow traveling off the roads, and we're on each other's nerves now. She observed that \"the other people from the Black Armory were nicer.\" I snapped at her, but… she's right. At least these days, anyway.\n\nThe barrage of questions continues. She wants to know why she's special. Why we needed her here. Where she comes from. I still can't muster up the answers. I find it easier to bury my face in this journal or pretend to be asleep than to face her questions. We are still quite a ways from the shore."

My clothes are looser, and she is concerned that I'm \"shedding mass.\" This is not how I ever wanted to get to know her.\n\nAt night, I started singing to myself to calm my nerves. She paid rapt attention and shortly asked me to teach her the song, \"Le Temps Des Cerises.\" She asks how I know it, but I'm in no condition to talk about him. It's just an old family tradition I tell her.\n\nIs it lying? I wonder if it really matters now.\n\n---\n\nEntry 151\n\nI tried to answer some of her questions. About the Black Armory, about life before the end… about what I believed in. About what makes us who we are. About what makes her who she is.\n\nIf you don't know where you come from, how can you know who you are? Our past defines us more than we are willing to admit.\n\nAll this—all that is lost—I'm telling her that she should care for it. Our past is precious and needs to be remembered.\n\nI tell her this realizing that I'm the one holding back. I'm the one keeping secrets. I'm the hypocrite. Stopped me from being able to even look at her.\n\nSomeday, probably soon, she'll be the only life our legacy has left.\n\nMaybe one day I won't be such a coward. Maybe then I'll tell her everything."

        "text": "Final Entry\n\nDear Adelaide,\n\nWhen those people and their drones found me alone at that deserted intersection they demanded to know where you were. I offered them the Obsidian Accelerator. I gave it freely.\n\nYou promised you would leave me, and you did… but you never said how far you would go, did you? You stayed close enough to watch through your scope.\n\nAs the man took aim at my head, I heard the shot and assumed I was dead. But it was him who was dead, not me. You were so far that none of us knew where to look.\n\nThe second man winged me with one of our own weapons. He began to gloat about that, but another round from you shut him up. Two more thunderous shots, and their drones were as dead as they were.\n\nI saw the glare from your scope disappear, and I knew you were heading away. I know you must feel guilty, but don't. It was I who wronged you.\n\nI grabbed the accelerator and got as far from the shouts of the aggressors as I could. They've been on my tail. By now, you're long gone and I've lead those people back inland.\n\nBut I'm done running. The end of my story is close, as it probably should be. So I guess it's time I tell you a few things about, well, you. The end of your life should have followed its natural trajectory. I'm ashamed I changed it for selfish reasons.\n\nDoes the name \"Adelaide\" bring you any flicker of recognition? It is your birth name, and you heard it every day of your life until the day I sent you without your consent into a new world.\n\nYou became Ada-1 when I robbed you of your end. I've loved you since before you were born, and in trying to give you everything, perhaps I've robbed you of a final human experience: a dignified death.\n\nI know I will not see you again. If you want to know about your past, know that you were born a second time in the Niobe Labs. When you were wounded at the labs and I saw you were losing your fight, I did what I always did when the chips were down: I… created something. You, Ada-1. From what I had almost completely lost. I did it out of fear of losing you forever. I charted the course of your life and made decisions that were yours to make, not mine.\n\nI hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for that.\n\nI was naïve. Looked too often to the past. I just couldn't let any of it go. I never did have much respect for the natural order of things. And Helga, well… she was the opposite of me. She only wanted to grow the Armory, to see its full potential. And Yuki helped make that vision possible. The two of them spent as much time looking ahead as I did looking back.\n\nI realize now that there's a balance to life. You look backward a little, you look forward a little. But most importantly, you live in the here and now. You appreciate what you have, because you never know when it'll all be snatched from you.\n\nLearn from our successes and our missteps. Be bold. Do not fear the future. Respect the past. And never forget where you came from. And try never to fear death, if you can help it. I know I don't anymore.\n\nYou know what's funny? I never considered how lucky I was for the time we had together. The envy of all the mothers who ever lived.\n\nI got to love you twice.\n\nYour Mother,\nHenriette"

She carries in her knapsack an unopened letter from her brother, her mother's ashes, a selection of seeds and cuttings from her favorite neighborhood trees and plants, and some thirty thousand songs and short videos on a hand-me-down myoelectric augment.\n\nOn the ship's manifest, Nasya Sarwar is one of two dozen classless Scopares, trash collectors and composters and caretakers devoted to endlessly tidying the many surfaces and people within the Yang Liwei that cannot or do not clean themselves. She hopes through hard work and perseverance, she will prove herself worthy of one of the ship's remaining civilian cryopods, or—even better—a promotion to an Auturge position where she believes she'll find the freedom to devote her waking hours entirely to the loving care of the ship's hydroponics facilities.\n\nNasya is quadrilingual. Several of her fellow Scopares are not: born monolinguals who got lucky in international Exodus lotteries, just like she did. When they realize that she can speak to some of them, they do their best to befriend her. They share meals. They show her photos of the loved ones they left behind. They explain the function of the ship's many impossible machines. In turn, she does her best to teach them how to speak to the others. In this way, they are all a little less alone.\n\nShe is twenty-seven years old.\n\n\n2.\n\nOn the day she awakens in the Distributary, she names herself Nasan Ar. She carries in her hands a small silver jar. A dent has crushed its lid; it is impossible to open. She does not know its provenance, but she feels an inexplicable tugging of grief in her chest when she thinks about walking on without it.\n\nShe makes herself a home under the largest tree she can find. In the early days, it is little more than a lean-to and a campfire, but she shares it willingly with whoever passes by. Her guests help her transform the lean-to into a proper cottage with several guest beds. One cottage becomes two, then two is three, until three becomes a village.\n\nNasan loves her guests and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become mother or mayor. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press tight around her. She is shackled to the earth by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. She feels monstrous. Why doesn't she love this? Why doesn't she want to stay?\n\nOne clear night, amid the honey-heavy smell of spring flowers and recent rain, she takes her silver jar and goes out into the dripping dark.\n\n\n3.\n\nShe wanders. She tries on lives like she is trying on city-tailored fashions: for a few weeks, she is a Corsair. Then for a whole summer, she is a field hand. When she tires of that, she balances books for an atom merchant who trades in radioactive materials. Nothing holds her. Seeing her silver jar, one man suggests she may be a treasure hunter. The idea sends her deep into a subterranean cavern where she finds no treasure, but instead bioluminescent worms and a Paladin who calls herself Sjur Eido.\n\n\"If you're looking for a job,\" Sjur says, \"I should introduce you to my boss.\"\n\n\n4.\n\nOn the day Nasan finds her calling, the Diasyrm styles her a translator. It confuses her, because the Speech is the Speech. Variations have developed over time, but none are so distant from each other that two Awoken from around the world cannot speak to each other. \"What do you mean?\" Nasan asks.\n\n\"Well,\" the Diasyrm says. \"I've been watching since you arrived. People look to you when they're fighting, and you try to understand each side before you try to help. When you speak, you do it deftly, without condescension.\" She considers Nasan. \"It seems to me that you lend people grace when you help them explain themselves.\"\n\nA little candle of pride flickers in Nasan's throat. \"That's just mediation,\" she says, glancing away.\n\n\"Don't sell yourself short. Anyone can break up a fight. Few people can so clearly grasp the spirit of a thought, then rephrase it so that deaf ears hear it. Gifts like that can end wars.\" Thinking on that, the Diasyrm sobers. \"We'll have to keep your talent to ourselves, for now. The Sanguine would just as soon cut out your tongue.\"\n\n\n5.\n\nThe Theodicy War is a fact of life until it isn't. The killing stops, but the wounds remain. Nasan helps the Awoken mend. Her friends urge her to speak publicly, to help people on a grander scale, but Nasan believes the most effective change happens in groups of fewer than ten."

The idea sucker-punches her—one crippling jab to every tender part of her. For four sleepless nights, she can scarcely draw a breath without gulping. She holds her silver jar to her forehead, focusing on its cool constant weight, and knows that she must leave.\n\n\n7.\n\nShe finds her old friend Sjur. Amid the feverish departure preparations, there is somehow time for an introduction to Mara. Nasan makes a pledge of herself and her skills. She will do what she can to convince those who might stay behind—\n\n\"No,\" Mara interrupts with the bite of unsweetened tea. \"I would not ask that of you or anyone else.\"\n\nNasan hesitates.\n\n\"Help those who have already made their choice, whatever it is. Help them with the grief.\" She clasps Nasan's hand. The stress around her eyes eases. \"That's more important.\"\n\n\n8.\n\nThe exodus is absolute in its terror. Nasan has never felt such a profound sense of schism—not when leaving lovers, nor communities, nor cherished hiding places.\n\nAs the Distributary shrinks behind their Hulls, she looks down at the little silver jar in her hands and wonders who she left behind in the world they're returning to protect. She wonders if they might still be alive.\n\n\n9.\n\nSjur is as plain and ready a companion as she ever was in the Diasyrm's camp, but Mara is an enigma. Nasan feels drawn to her, not by her porcelain beauty, but by her onion-skin layers of defense. There are so many different truths that ring through Mara's carefully chosen words: chords of nuanced meaning that she feels she might be able to separate out into cleaner notes for frightened minds craving simplicity.\n\nShe does what she can. In quiet hours and fragmented conversations, she becomes an unconventional counselor to the would-be queen.\n\nWhen the first fragile attempts at rebuilding society run afoul of the Long Unquiet Night, then the discovery of the Traveler and the Fallen, and then inevitably turn to riot and desertion, Nasan goes to Mara again to pledge her services. \"Let me go after them,\" she begs, not a day after the proclamation that they all hear in their skulls instead of their ears. \"I don't mean to change their minds or convince them to come back. I just—\"\n\n\"Then what DO you mean to do?\" Sjur asks curiously. Mara watches her with ageless patience, waiting for her to find the words.\n\nNasan purses her lips. \"I want them to understand that you are—that you—that you are good. That you aren't what they think.\" Seeing Sjur bristle, she holds up her hand. To her relief, Mara makes a slight warding gesture as well. \"And if they know that and still wish to live apart from us on Earth, that's fine. That's their choice.\"\n\n\"I don't need them to understand that,\" Mara says softly. There is the faintest husk of grief in her steady voice.\n\n\"No,\" Nasan agrees, relieved that Mara is willing to consider this truth. \"You don't. You have the courage to be disliked, and that is uncommon. But it is just as important, sometimes, to cultivate good will...\" Especially if you have forgotten what it feels like to not know everything, she thinks.\n\nMara looks away. Nasan watches closely and thinks that perhaps she has been heard. Sjur shifts her weight impatiently, tired by all this meaningful silence. It has been a long nineteen hours.\n\n\"If you go,\" Mara says finally, \"you cannot come back.\"\n\nNasan hears the truth in it. She reaches to clasp Mara's hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n10.\n\nSo she goes to Earth. She carries a survival kit, a hunting rifle, and the tarnished silver jar that has followed her through her whole existence.\n\nShe finds no Awoken as she wanders an empty prairie. She spreads no gospel.\n\nIt is not two weeks before a band of Risen—wild with fear of themselves, each other, and the unknown—ambush her lonely campsite and kill her in her sleep."

Marrow-deep instinct drives that decision; she could not declare its etymology if someone held a knife to her throat.\n\nGol explains that there is a settlement a few days' walk to the east, that there is no road, and that the wilderness is regularly patrolled by roving aliens who will try to kill them both. As he speaks, Orin looks around. They are surrounded by a young forest vivacious with birds and clouds of gnats. It is impossible to imagine that a deadly alien might be lurking somewhere nearby. But Gol found her. Gol knows more about the world than she does. She trusts him.\n\nShe scavenges the leaf litter until she finds a fallen tree limb. \"Will this help?\" she asks him, testing its heft. He twists his wings, puzzled. \"...Against the aliens,\" she elaborates.\n\n\"Oh.\" Courteous, he pretends to consider it, then, \"No. Probably not. They have guns.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she says, though she doesn't. She breaks off the smaller branches, using her foot for leverage. Soon, she has a crude mace. It is heavy, slow, and does not break when she tests it against a tree trunk.\n\nShe doesn't know what the aliens look like. She does not know what guns are.  She does trust Gol. But, she can't help thinking, if an alien tried to attack her while she was armed with a stick like this, she would have no trouble crushing its skull.\n\n\n12.\n\nThey reach the settlement. It is smoldering cinder and ruin. Gol frets about \"fission products\" and \"acute radiation,\" so Orin lingers at a distance and studies what remains. A cat moves among the most distant rubble, hunting for mice. A tattered banner stirs in the breeze. She sees nothing more, so she ignores Gol's warning and goes in for a closer look.\n\nShe finds bodies. Adults, mostly. Some children. There are little houses for big animals, but there are no big animals among the dead.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" she asks, overcome by grief for these charred strangers. \"Aliens?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. The Fallen don't often use nuclear weapons. It ruins the land. My guess is that a Warlord raided this place for its livestock and then set off a bomb.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nGol gives a little shrug, bobbing in place. \"Why not? No one was here to stop them.\"\n\nOrin clenches her mace a little tighter. She feels nauseous. \"Can you tell when it happened?\"\n\nHe runs the computations. \"Not precisely. Less than thirty-six hours ago, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I should have walked faster,\" she mutters, and then bends over to be sick.\n\n\"You can't do that here,\" Gol interrupts anxiously. \"Stop, Orin. Stop. You have radiation poisoning. If you're sick here, you'll die here, and then I'll have to resurrect you here, and you'll be sick and die again and again. You have to move. Come. I told you not to walk around here.\""

She hunts them to better hunt Warlords, and makes many enemies of many older, wilier Risen than she.\n\n\n14.\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard finds her pinned down in a box canyon, fighting alone and out of ammunition against a gang of six mercenaries. She is a graceless fighter with an unflappably grim resolve, so when they sweep in to help her, she does not immediately recognize them as the cavalry; she sees them coming, considers the odds, and then raises her empty Scorch Cannon to wield as a maul. Seventeen to one? She'll try her luck.\n\nThey laugh about it later over weak tea and hardtack.\n\n\n15.\n\nWhen the Guard invites her to join them, they present her with a war hammer. It is as tall as she is. Along its grip, they've engraved the words I AM THE END OF ALL THINGS in tidy block print.\n\n\n16.\n\nShe meets a young woman whose skin looks like hers.\n\n\"Where did you come from?\" Orin asks, staring too hard, standing a little too close. It is impossible not to: every other blue-skinned person she has ever seen has either been dead or a distant figure hurrying for a gleaming ship.\n\nThe young woman cringes away from her. \"The Sinaloan ruins.\"\n\n\"Are there other people there like you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHearing her question, one of her friends pulls her aside to point up at the sky. \"Your people are up there,\" he says. \"They live among the asteroids.\"\n\n\"Why aren't they here?\" she asks, but he has no answer.\n\n\n17.\n\nThe everyday rhythm of the Pilgrim Guard suits her for decades: eradicate Warlords and alien invaders; protect mortal civilians; guide homeless refugees to safety. Their numbers wax and wane over time, but they are forever the watchers-in-the-dark, the living-shield-that-shelters, the ladder-which-humanity-will-climb-toward-rebirth. Inspiring campfire speeches are an endless fact of life, and they buoy her until she begins to recognize the leitmotifs of self-sacrificing heroism.\n\nOrin loves her leaders and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become soldier or symbol. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press around her. She is shackled to the wilds by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. Alone on night watch, she tells Gol that she feels monstrous.

Rumors call it \"The Last Safe City,\" a place of peace and prosperity guarded by indestructible Old Russian warriors who fight alongside twenty-foot-tall wolves (whatever those are).\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard has heard of many so-called safe cities. They come and go, but mostly they go.\n\nStill, they reroute their caravan. The land down south is good: arable, temperate, and with too many indigenous parasites for the Fallen to wish it as a customary home. Even if there is no safe city there, it is a better place to guide civilians than the ravaged deserts and plains of the north.\n\nOrin hopes the rumors are true, but it is a selfish hope: If the city is real, and people are safe there, then maybe she can rest.\n\n\n19.\n\n\"City\" is a misnomer; it has been a misnomer since this place's inception. It is a chaotic sprawl of tents and shabby lean-tos. There is not a single permanent structure among them. The streets are nothing more than muddy pathways that smell of waste and smoke. But the people! Neither Orin nor Gol have seen so many people in all their lives.\n\nFilthy children scream with laughter as they play tag around salvaged tanks. A civilian militia stands vigil over cassava farmers. Armored Risen bicker over where they should mark the city's borders and how best to defend them.\n\nThe Traveler looms overhead as Orin wanders through it all, wide-eyed and exhilarated.\n\n\n20.\n\nThe Pilgrim Guard prepares to move out, provisioned to make an eighteen-month expedition through the far north.

They are uncommon, though Exos are even rarer. Most have Ghosts, as she does. A few do not, and it's these people that Orin is most fascinated by.\n\nShe dogs them with relentless patience, asking question after question: Where did you come from? Why have you come here? Where are the rest of us? Where did you get that gun? What are those bullets made out of? Why doesn't everyone have those bullets? Do people ever move to avoid you? Do you hear voices when you are alone? Are your dreams ever like omens? If I was one of you, why didn't anyone ever come looking for me?"

His Hildian sustained damage during a dog-fight with a Fallen skiff, and now an important pump is leaking. He cannot find the source of the leak, nor does he have the supplies to repair it. The rest of the Awoken are at home, in the Reef.\n\nThe gun is a standard-issue Tigerspite AR; it uses cased telescoped rounds made of a proprietary plasteel-spinmetal blend. There are engineers hard at work on manufacturing techniques that will allow for widespread distribution of the weapon to Risen and civilian populations on Earth.\n\nPeople do avoid him. Earthborn and Risen Awoken almost never speak to him; he is surprised that she bothered. He does hear voices; he does have prophetic dreams. He describes it all in detail and she is shocked by how familiar it sounds. It is like listening to a recording of herself.\n\nAt her final question, he hesitates. He runs a grimy hand through his hair and looks up at the stars. They have been talking a long time. \"If we're going to talk some more,\" he says at last, \"we might as well have a drink.\"\n\n\n23.\n\nNamqi is not particularly tall, nor particularly handsome. Taken in isolation, parts of him are beautiful. His nose. His hands. The lines of his throat. The coruscating light that passes over his skin fascinates her; she watches to see if its patterns match her own. They do not.\n\nMost of all, Orin is struck by his ability to listen with empathy. He is quiet more often than not. Long silences don't frighten him. And when he speaks, he does it deftly, without condescension.\n\n\n24.\n\nIt takes eight weeks to repair the leaking pump. In that time, Orin convinces Namqi to break queenslaw and smuggle her and Gol beyond the Vestian Outpost. She is determined to understand why she revolted against her own people.\n\nThey are scarcely a half-day's burn toward Interamnia before they are intercepted by Galliots painted in the Queen's colors.\n\n\n25.\n\n\"Woof,\" Sjur Eido says when she sees Orin for the first time, \"Mara's gonna hate this.\" She crosses the detainment cell to get a better look at Gol. \"Figured this might happen eventually, but I'd always hoped...\" She pulls at the nape of her neck, then gives a little half-shrug: well, what can you do.\n\nTurning, she looks at Namqi. \"You know you broke the law, right?\"\n\nHe nods.\n\nShe claps him on the shoulder and smiles. \"My man.\"\n\n\n26.\n\nTwo Paladins deliver her to Mara Sov. Gol is not permitted in the court, nor is Namqi.\n\n\"I knew you,\" Orin says before Mara can speak. It is uncourtly etiquette, she supposes, but they are alone and she is too bold to fear offense.\n\n\"What do you remember?\"\n\nOrin gives a slight shake of her head. Moments pass. Mara, too, is comfortable with silence. Behind her mask of composed indifference, her eyes are sharp with curiosity.\n\n\"Why did I leave?\" Orin asks.\n\n\"You wished to be my emissary.\"\n\n\"And you banished me for it?\" She squints. \"That doesn't seem like something you'd do...\"\n\nMara smiles faintly. \"No.\"\n\n\n27.\n\nThey have several more conversations.\n\nThe revelations are absolute in their terror. Orin has never felt such a profound sense of schism—not when learning that most mortals would sooner swallow cyanide pills than come face-to-face with a Risen, nor that the Eliksni were once abandoned by the Traveler, nor that almost all Warlords are Lightbearers.\n\n\n28.\n\nBut the queenslaw is, of course, the queenslaw. It must be upheld—but the spirit of the law often differs from its letter.\n\nNamqi accepts a sentence of five years' indentured servitude to the crown for smuggling Orin into Reef holdings. They let him pick his detail and negotiate his salary.\n\nOrin's case is not so simple. She is not who she was, so after vigorous philosophical debate, it is decreed that she cannot be held accountable for her past oaths. But she engaged in witting trespass, aided and abetted by a learned civilian, and for that, she must sacrifice a boon: an unnamed future debt of the crown's choosing.\n\nOrin accepts the sentence gladly and returns to Earth to mend her wounds. She needs to think. She needs to talk."

The grateful civilians of the Last Safe City style them Guardians, and they wear the title well.\n\nOrin is glad to see her friends doing so well. She does not rejoin them.\n\n\n30.\n\nDuring his sentence, Namqi maintains daily contact with Orin via vidcom and holoprojection.\n\nWhen he is released, she begs him to come get her. She wants to understand what humanity was trying to achieve before it stooped to setting off nuclear warheads in order to steal a few cows.\n\nThey scour the inner planets in his Hildian. When parts of it break down, they work odd jobs.\n\nThey are deliriously happy.\n\nCenturies pass.\n\n\n31.\n\nOn the day that Sjur Eido dies, she receives a call from Mara Sov. \"I would ask for my boon,\" the queen says with shaking voice.\n\nIt is the first time she dares to trust a Guardian. It will not be the last.\n\n\n32.\n\nThe Queen paces as Orin leans on her war hammer. \"I need to know who killed her,\" Mara says.\n\n\"To know, or to see them killed?\"\n\nMara's grief and anger blaze across her face. She looks out at the Reef as she struggles to master herself.\n\nOrin imagines Namqi dead and clenches her war hammer a little tighter.\n\nAt last, Mara says, \"First, to know.\" She gives Orin the strange coin that the search party found on Sjur's body. \"I'm not sure it was a murder.\"\n\n\n33.\n\nThe search sends her deep into a sublunar cavern where she finds no enemies, but instead clouds of steam and a half-man with grasping tentacles where his face should be.\n\n\"Forgive them,\" he rasps as she crushes his windpipe in her fist.\n\n\"Who?\" she snarls, tightening her grip.\n\nHis face writhes with growing urgency. Reminding herself that she came here for answers first and vengeance second, she pushes him away. He staggers, steadies, reaches into his robes to draw something out—\n\n\"Orin!\" Gol warns, but she's already seen it. She hefts her war hammer and strikes him hard in the chest. It is like hitting a ball off of a tee; there is no resistance. He caroms off of a dewy boulder with a sickening crunch—that is his spine; he will never stand straight again—and as he hits the ground, a tarnished silver jar slips from his fingers. The sound echoes as it bounces away into the dark.\n\n\n34.\n\nOrin uses a hunting knife and brute strength to puncture the jar's dented lid. She turns it over and pours a thin stream of pale grey powder into her gloved palm.\n\n\"Dust returns, it ever returns,\" the man chuckles wheezily. She looks up and he is gone."

When she reaches for Namqi, she feels as if she is falling into him, being pulled through him, sieved into smaller and smaller scarves of some atom-self that he breathes into the blood of his bones. When she continues her hunt for the Queen, she feels a crushing fist around her windpipe. There is something she must say, but she has no words to say it. There is somewhere she must go. Someone she must be.\n\nIt is not horrifying, though she thinks it should be. Instead, it is unspeakably lonely.\n\n\n36.\n\nIt grows steadily worse, until it is not possible to tell the difference between day and dream.\n\nShe tries to describe her number-color synesthesia to Gol, to Namqi, to Mara. She sees green and thinks \"nine.\" She reads \"purple\" and tastes nine.\n\nThey all tell her to stop. To rest. To be still. There have been other breakthroughs. Other messages. The Nine are known.\n\nShe cannot.\n\nShe hunts for the man with the writhing face.\n\nShe hunts for herself.\n\n\n37.\n\nOn the day that Namqi dies, no one can reach her or Gol, though they do try.\n\nShe does not find out for months.\n\n\n38.\n\nOn the day she meets Wu Ming, she is on Bamberga. She has just left a Gensym lab. She has just read a transcript of Namqi's last words. Her hands are shaking. She feels nauseous. She feels she can see herself in third-person, tottering to a safe place to sit and cry.\n\nWu Ming is a bonfire in the darkness, and she crawls toward his warmth.\n\n\n39.\n\nWu Ming is ravenous for her stories of the Nine. He asks whether she's met them, whether they can give a man power, whether they know a way out of this solar system. Orin cannot answer any of his questions but she cannot keep her own stories down. She is sick with them; they come out in a compulsive bilious stream and when she is emptied, she talks of herself. Of her grief. Of her restlessness. How she feels the most alive in the empty spaces between blinks. How she feels she is a snake perpetually sloughing away its skin, except this last molt is all wrong and she is caught in the ghost-throat of her old self.\n\nWu Ming leaves his questions by the wayside as he is drawn inexorably into the gravity well of her desperate honesty. Her confessions lower his defenses. He talks of himself. Of his fear. Of his loneliness. How he feels he is one fingernail away from plummeting into an abyss. How he feels vicious resentment every time he is brought back from the dead: He never asked for the gift of the Light.\n\n\n40.\n\nThey make excuse after excuse to meet again. Every conversation is colored by excavated truths; every day they feel they will reach some bedrock that will break them to pieces. It is as frightening as it is intoxicating.\n\n\n41.\n\nLies!\n\nLies!\n\nLies!\n\nHe is not Wu Ming—he is a man named Eli—a man named Dredgen Hope—a man named the Drifter—\n\nHe is not vulnerable—he is a paranoid con man—he is a dead-hearted murderer—he is a cowardly liar—\n\nHe is not her friend—he is waiting to make his move—he has ALWAYS been waiting to make his move—\n\nShe is stupid; she is so stupid to have fallen for his lies!\n\nShe cannot mend this!\n\n\n42.\n\nShe leaves and so too does the Light. The severance is absolute in its terror. She has not felt such a profound sense of—\n\nS C H I S M?\n\nit can be mended\n\nOrin is not your name."

And every moment thereafter was dedicated to keeping him alive, whether he liked it or not. They were turbulent times, before the Last City. Before humanity found hope for the future. I was prepared to kill for it. Die for it.\" —A Ghost of the Dark Age\n\n\nHe opened his eyes in the night air and took an even breath. He wasn't sure how long he'd been asleep, but his immediate instinct was to—\n\n\"Run.\"\n\nHe froze. The voice wasn't his.\n\n\"You have to run.\"\n\nThe man stood up in the evening light. He looked down at himself and saw that someone had dressed him for his own funeral.  He didn't laugh, but he thought it was funny. The voice continued. \"Can you hear me? Risen fight for territory in these highlands. We have to move.\"\n\nFor the first time, he noticed a small drone buzzing in the air around him, a blazing eye at its center glowing like a blue sun. It jerked its frame to the left, indicating the light of a faraway settlement. \"Head west. I have friends there. They'll help us.\"\n\nThe man stared at the drone, frowned, and ran in the opposite direction.\n\n\"What? Hey!\" the voice cried out behind him. He fled into darkness, tall grass on either side of him flying past. The only thing he could hear was his own breathing and the loud crush of the vegetation he trampled. He was surprised at how fast he was moving. The voice called to him again, far behind him.\n\nHe heard the roar of the machine before he saw it, and he didn't feel a thing as it exploded out of the tall grass to the right and landed on him, crushing him beneath its bulk.\n\n**\n\nHe opened his eyes in the night air and took an even breath.\n\n\"You died,\" the drone explained, hovering over him. It was smeared with a dark, filmy paste. \"I brought you back.\"\n\nHe stood up and looked down at himself. Same clothes. Nothing hurt. The hulking wreck of the machine that had killed him sat in pieces a few meters away, inside a dark, sooty crater.\n\nThe body of an armored man lay sprawled over the smoldering open-air cockpit, his helmet punctured by a small hole about the size of... the drone.\n\n\"Are you ready to listen? Let me take you to my friends,\" it said. \"This region is full of raiders like this man. Led by Risen like you. You've got a lot of catching up to do.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you?\" the man spoke for the first time.\n\n\"I'm your Ghost. My only purpose is to support you,\" the drone replied.\n\n\"You work for me?\"\n\n\"In a manner of speaking, yes.\"\n\n\"Is this the afterlife?\"\n\n\"In a manner of speaking,\" the drone said, nodding at the western lights once more. \"Can we go?\"\n\n\"Not that way.\" The man headed in the opposite direction.\n\nThe drone watched him trample the high grass and disappear. It stared up at the massive, disfigured orb that dominated the sky, then made a small adjustment to the orbit pattern of its modular armor.\n\nIt hurried after the man."

But how to live.\" —A Dark Age drifter\n\n\nEaton received its first visitors in years.\n\nGermaine watched the armored men and women climb down from their silver transports. They were Risen, beings said to be unkillable, and they fought against each other in a war without end somewhere beyond Eaton's borders. This particular group, the Iron Lords, represented new ideology, and claimed they fought to put an end to the fighting.\n\nLed by a man named Dryden, they had paid each family in Eaton several months' worth of supplies and rations to stay the week. They planned to stage an ambush on another of their kind, known only as the Red Man.\n\nTwo weeks ago, survival was in doubt. Now, because of the generosity of the Iron Lords, their little town would make it through the winter.\n\nGermaine's friend Judson emerged from a neighboring supply shed and stuck a single finger in the air as the riders strode up. Germaine chuckled and shook his head, but said nothing.\n\n\"How you livin',\" Judson  greeted the Risen, holding his finger high.\n\n\"Settle down, Judson,\" Germaine called out.\n\n\"Shut your hole, Germaine,\" Judson returned, hand still in the air. \"Your name is stupid, and you're stupid, too.\"\n\nGermaine shook his head and grinned ruefully.\n\nJudson had warned the town against the arrangement, shouting to everyone who would listen that he'd take care of food, that the \"iron freaks\" would only bring trouble. He was a very good huntsman—possibly the best Eaton had ever seen, and somehow produced deer, duck, and bull from the decimated hills. But even Judson had come up short for months. The war beyond Eaton had intensified. The adults went hungry so the children could eat. It wasn't a sustainable position.\n\n\"We'll be out of your way soon,\" said one of the Iron Lords, who nodded at Judson as he passed by. Her voice was as metallic and cold as her helmet. Judson spat, and didn't take his eyes off them as they walked the length of the town to secure hidden positions around its perimeter."

        "text": "\"Sir. This is awful.\" —A Dark Age drifter\n\n\nYu was nine cycles old and visited often. She and her family lived next to Judson, and sometimes they sent her to Germaine when their boisterous neighbor was too belligerent. As he was today. Germaine didn't mind.\n\n\"Judson doesn't think it was a good idea to let the iron people stay with us,\" she was saying. She paced slowly back and forth across the length of the shack, stepping carefully over the game of cards Germaine had laid out on the bare dirt floor.\n\n\"I know. But Judson says a lot of things. And sometimes you gotta be decisive. You see how much food they gave us?\" Germaine said, placing a card down. A lamp flickered nearby, next to the largest pile of ration boxes this shack had ever held.\n\n\"Judson knows how to use guns. I've seen him. Maybe he can—\"\n\n\"No, no he can't. Those things out there, you can't kill. Get that out of your mind right now.\"\n\nYu kept pacing, frowning slightly as she considered it.\n\n\"More food is nice, but Judson thinks they're going to get us dead. I think he might run away,\" she said.\n\nHe laid another card down. \"Appreciate what you get. Your parents were skipping dinner so you could have yours. The Risen solved that for us. For a little while. We have to let them stay.\"\n\nShe stopped pacing to consider it, and looked up at the sheet metal ceiling. \"I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"You won't,\" Germaine said. \"Why don't you go see what your parents are up to? I'm a little beat.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she said, shrugging. She left.\n\nGermaine opened a small box of water from the pile of ration packs and poured a tin-full. Yu hadn't noticed because it was difficult to see in the flickering lamplight, but his hands shook.\n\n**\n\nJudson's breath steamed in the night air as he shut the gate that bordered town as quietly as he could. Shivering would mean shaking the rickety thing and waking up Yu's family, so he kept the handle gripped tight as he pushed it back into place. He now stood on the pass out of Eaton Valley.\n\nAs he turned around, he walked right into Germaine.\n\n\"Didn't see you there, brother,\" Judson growled low, stopping just short of throwing an elbow into his neighbor's throat. He backed up a step. Just one.\n\n\"Where're you running to this late?\" Germaine asked. \"Brother.\"\n\n\"What are you, dense? Away from this before the shooting starts.\"\n\n\"We gotta trust this Lord Dryden knows what he's doing,\" Germaine said.\n\nJudson shook his head. \"You and all the deal-makers are gonna get this town dead. These guys are worse than the stories.\"\n\n\"You know how I feel about Risen, but they saved us this week.\"\n\nJudson sneered. \"No one ever believes it 'cuz Risen look like you and me, but they'll kill you without meaning to. Naturally as breathing. They can't help it.\"\n\n\"They're lookin' to jump one man. Just one. We gotta see this through. Even the Risen can contain a fight at that scale.\"\n\n\"You gonna move? Or do I move you?\"\n\nGermaine stepped to the side. \"I'm not the law. But where you gonna go? There's nothin' but war-land out there. And their prey is comin'.\"\n\n\"I'm a tracker. Kept this town fed for years before you got here. I'll be fine. And that other Risen won't care about one man passing through. I got nothing to hide. Just need to get away. If you all want to play bait for the warring dead, have a nice life.\"\n\nGermaine chuckled.\"What's funny?\" Judson sneered in that low voice again.\n\n\"I don't know how you do it. I almost admire you.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"You've got no fear. Have a nice life, brother. See you when I see you.\" Germaine walked back to the gate."

No food or water for miles.\"\n\n\"I manage.\"\n\n\"I have ways to make you tell us what we want to know.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"The Warlord campaign in this region never reached into the southern valley.

I planned to scout the valley myself, but now I think I'll bring some friends.\"\n\n**\n\nGermaine's hands shook when the Warlords, Risen who conquered the land they found, brought Judson back to Eaton during midday a week later. Half the town came out to see them.\n\nOne of the men wore red armor that fit the description of the Warlord that Dryden and his Lords were waiting for.\n\nThey say that one Risen, reasonably armed, can annihilate an army. Two Risen, assuming adequate cover for Ghost support, can fight infinite armies indefinitely.\n\nSix Warlords dismounted their machines in a line at the center of town, weapons drawn. They dropped Judson on his knees in front of them. No restraints. He looked unhurt.\n\n\"Does anyone want to claim this runt?\" asked the Red Man.\n\n\"We will,\" Germaine said. People groaned. Yu tried to run to Judson, but her parents held her back.\n\n\"A question, first,\" said the Red Man. \"Where are the Iron Lords? We saw one of their Ghosts. One of these?\" He tapped the bladed carapace of his own drone companion as it floated past him, its eye fixed on the townspeople. \"They like to meddle. Maybe they helped you, brought you some food? It would explain how you survive out here in this wasteland. But I can guarantee you their motivations are not in your best interest.\" The Red Man paused, scanned the crowd as his Ghost orbited above him.\n\n\"The Iron Lords are trying to disrupt the established order. And we're here to liberate you from them. You're under our care, now. So. Where are they?\"\n\nGermaine shut his eyes a long moment. When no one else spoke, he decided he would. \"You're right. They were here. But they're long gone. We paid them for supplies and they moved on a week ago.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" The Red Man raised his hand cannon and shot Yu's father in the head. The entire crowd flinched and huddled together as the man fell backward. Yu's mother cried out in fury, but held her child tight.\n\n\"Hand to my heart,\" Germaine said, holding his breath as he waited for the hidden Iron Lords to make a move. The Red Man held his gun in the air, watching the townspeople intently. The other Warlords scanned the horizon, gleaming weapons at the ready.\n\nJudson took the pregnant pause as an opportunity to pull a Fallen shock blade from one of the Warlord machines. He gave a triumphant yell and decapitated the armored Risen closest to him. As the body fell, he jabbed the length of the blade through the Red Man's back. A third Warlord pulled the glaive out of Judson's hands and stabbed him in the side with a gauntlet blade, then hurled him backwards over the machines.\n\nAll hell broke loose around Germaine as the Iron Lords suddenly opened fire from their positions in the surrounding hills. The townspeople scattered as the fallen Warlords rose in scintillating pillars of Light, the weapons in their hands roaring to life and spitting tracers.\n\n**\n\nThe Ghost watched from high above the chaos. Over the ages, it had gotten very good at hiding. It had gotten very good at all the peculiar things its chosen had asked it to learn.\n\nDown below, gunfire and explosions of Light tore through the collection of huts and shacks. The townspeople fled for their lives in the midst of fire and otherworldly flame as the Iron Lords finally abandoned their sniper positions in the hills to close in on the Warlords at the town center.\n\nThrough it all, the Ghost saw one of the men emerge out of the discharge of an errant explosive device, cradling the body of a child. He moved to relative safety behind one of the shacks and knelt down, holding an ear to the child's face. She was trying to speak.\n\nOne of the armored riders in the town square raised a heavy machine gun in one hand and raked the length of Eaton with golden tracers. The Ghost lost visibility on the townspeople as the hail of machinegun fire filled its vantage point with a rolling cloud of dirt and dust.\n\nThe annihilating, sense-shattering explosions came soon after, and the Ghost increased its elevation.\n\nIt waited until long after the battle had died out, and the surviving Risen had all left, before lowering itself back to earth. It wasn't even sure which side had won. It didn't matter.\n\nThe day had turned to dusk."

Mild climate was the only reason the shacks and huts that made up most of the town remained standing.\n\nBut the storm of Light versus Light had left scorched earth and shadows behind. And the bones of the dead. It was a blood red dusk. Ghost hovered above him.\n\nThe man looked down at his hands. He tried to chuckle, but coughed instead.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Ghost asked.\n\nHe stood up, straighter than he had in a long time. Easier to seem like people when you slouch.\n\n\"Germaine?\" Ghost asked.\n\n\"That's not my name.\"\n\n\"You let them call you that.\"\n\nThe man turned to look at his Ghost. \"It's not my name.

Yu,\" Ghost continued.\n\n\"Stop talking,\" he replied.\n\n\"What did she tell you? You were speaking to her at the end.\"\n\nHe didn't respond. It would be lifetimes before he told Ghost the answer. But he would remember.\n\n\"You could have helped her.\"\n\nThe shovel hit the dirt harder. \"I told you to shut up.\"\n\n\"You could have saved them all.\"\n\nThe man had nothing to say.\n\nHe must have been making more noise than he thought, because just as he finished digging a grave big enough for the bones, a voice called out. He dropped the shovel, stared across the vacant town square at the smoldering ruin of the Diaz barn.\n\nEaton was dead. No point in keeping his secret any longer.\n\nHe crossed the distance at a speed and ease that would have shocked his neighbors and rounded a corner to find Judson, on the ground, leaning against the barn door. There was a cannon in Judson's hand, and his eyes opened wide when he recognized the man and his Ghost.\n\nJudson lifted the gun with a shaking fist. His other hand clutched a dark stain on his side.\n\n\"He's lost a lot of blood,\" Ghost said, its Light spilling across the scene.\n\n\"You were one 'a them all along,\" Judson sneered.\n\nThe man chuckled. \"All my lives, brother.\"\n\n\"You got us killed, you son of a—\"\n\nThe man kicked the firearm out of Judson's hand with no urgency at all. He knelt down to point a finger. \"No, no, that one's on you. Those Warlords caught you. What else were they gonna do? I wanted to stop you from leaving, but I didn't think I had the right.\"\n\nJudson reached out to grab his throat. The man caught his hand in a vice-grip instead, a crushing handshake. Judson frowned and struggled, but he was exhausted. Dying. And the man had strength that belied his frame.\n\nThe man lifted his other hand, smoldering from a Solar glow, and held it against Judson's wound. His former friend managed a high-pitched wail, but couldn't break the man's grip, though he tried and tried.\n\nThe man nodded at Judson, addressing his Ghost. \"Do you see how he never gives up? Because he knows this one life is all he has? No fear.\"\n\n\"Those Risen out there?\" The man finished cauterizing the wound and used his suddenly-cool hand to wave indiscriminately into the darkening night. \"They'd be long dead if they were him. All they know is war. This man survives.\"\n\nJudson made a gurgling sound. He had stopped struggling, but the man kept a grip on his hand.\n\n\"You wanted me to save him? Even if this works, he could never show me how to live. Not like he lives. And that's on you.\"\n\nGhost watched, but made minute adjustments to his orbiting armor and sent Light-based scans cascading across the ruins of town. If there were lingering Warlords or Iron Lords nearby, they would have to run.\n\nThe man stood up. Judson was dead.\n\n\"Maybe you should have told him you were bringing livestock in from a hundred leagues away and releasing them for him to catch,\" Ghost said.\n\n\"I mean—did you see how happy he was? How they all were? They got to eat,\" the man replied. \"Give someone something to chase and you give them purpose.\"\n\n\"You're pathetic. This is what you aspire to be? A perennial liar who plays house with refugees? These people are dead because of us!\"\n\n\"I lived here as one of them.\"\n\n\"You could be so much more. Let me show you how powerful your Light can become.\"\n\nThe man walked past his Ghost and brought Judson's corpse to the center of town. As he began digging again, he noticed the bloated, spherical husk that dominated the sky. It had been out of his life for a while, but it seemed a lot closer to earth tonight.\n\nHe raised a hand to salute it with a single finger, as Ghost looked on.\n\n\"How you livin'?\" he said, and gave a smile to the heavens that ended at his eyes."

Wu served anyone who could pay, but his clientele were often Risen. Not because he provided a menu particularly suited to them, but because he had built his bar at the foot of a mountain called Felwinter Peak.\n\nFelwinter was a former Warlord—the only one, it was said, to hold an entire mountain all by himself. He now rode with the Iron Lords, and Felwinter Peak was staunchly the territory of the Iron Wolves. They had never given Wu permission to build the bar.\n\nHe had never asked.\n\nAlmost to a person, the patrons tonight were without Ghosts. High winds and inhospitable cold meant those without Ghosts rarely visited. But tonight, word had reached the general population that Warlords were back in the region. No shots had been fired. Not yet. But it was enough to get every poor, Lightless wretch from miles around into Wu's bar, where chances were an Iron Lord or Lady might be having a drink. Wu Ming didn't mind.\n\nThe door swung open again, and a trio of armored figures marched in from the cold. \"Welcome to the End of the World,\" greeted the serving frame. The Warlords shouldered past the 55-30 and headed straight for Wu Ming at the counter.\n\n\"What can I get you?\" Wu asked, giving a smile that ended at his eyes.\n\nThe leading Warlord, a hulking man with shoulder guards larger than his brain, grunted, \"Food. Everything you have.\" \n\nWu raised an eyebrow. \"Sure. That'll be... well, a lotta Glimmer.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" the giant man said, grabbing Wu by the lapels of his stormcoat. \"Give us everything you have in the back, or we'll gut you and eat you alive.\"\n\n\"Hey Citan,\" a woman's voice said. \"Pick on someone your own size.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to a helmeted figure standing a few feet behind Citan. She only came up to the giant man's sternum.\n\n\"Lady Efrideet,\" Citan muttered.\n\nWu Ming's gaze went from the Iron Lady to the three Warlords positioned around the bar amongst his Lightless patrons. He cursed under his breath and braced to duck."

        "text": "Wu Ming looked on as the Warlords surrounded the lone Iron Lady.\n\n\"End of the World is Wolves territory,\" Efrideet was saying. \"And so is the entirety of Felwinter Peak.\"\n\n\"That changes tonight.\" A crescent of Light arced between the Warlord's open hands. \"I have an army of raiders and a fireteam of Risen waiting on my command. Felwinter's lost his mind siding with you lot.\"\n\nUnderneath the helm, Citan's eyes flickered from the Iron Lady to his Warlord ally positioned behind her. The flanking Warlord raised a massive hand cannon and thundered a bullet—\n\nDirectly into Citan's chest as Efrideet dropped to a knee. She swung her cannon to her right side with her left fist and let loose with a roaring double-tap behind her, shattering the rear Warlord's head. Wu Ming saw that she hadn't so much as looked.\n\nThe third Warlord's submachine weapon fired a spray of bullets that hammered the floor as Efrideet rolled. Wu cursed inwardly as wood splinters went flying all over the room. People screamed.\n\nBut it was already over. The third Warlord crumpled. Efrideet's solar knife had divided his head.\n\n\"Hold!\" the Lady barked, firing her cannon into the ceiling as three Ghosts materialized above their charges. Bits of wood fell on her shoulder. Wu Ming cursed audibly this time.\n\n\"You know who I am,\" she shouted at the room. \"At this distance, I could shoot all of you out of the air swifter than you could ever bring your Risen back.\"\n\nThe Traveler's children froze, their shells spinning aggressively in the air like metallic bees.\n\n\"You're free to go,\" she told them. \"But your Risen stay with me. Follow the Iron Decree and you'll get them back. In time.\" The Ghosts looked at one another.\n\n\"Tell the Warlords,\" she sneered. \"Felwinter Peak belongs to the Wolves.\"\n\nThe Ghosts left the way their owners came. The bar patrons began murmuring.\n\nEfrideet's Ghost, always a quick thinker, started playing music: Lady Skorri singing an old hymn.\n\nThe patrons backed away from the three Warlord bodies, but began chattering amongst themselves. The din of conversation gradually filled the room and built to a dull roar. The music helped.\n\n\"Is this why you asked me here?\" Efrideet said, holstering her weapon. \"You said you had some business that paid.\"\n\n\"I did. You just finished it,\" he responded, reaching out with a fistful of Glimmer. The Iron Lady stared down at it, gawking beneath her helmet.\n\n\"Who the hell pays you?\"\n\n\"I have means,\" Wu Ming said, chuckling. \"Stick with me, sister. I'll make you rich. I promise.\"\n\nShe eagerly took the sapphire cubes out of his hand. Glimmer represented pure material potential.\n\n\"You didn't bring Felwinter,\" Wu said.\n\nShe eyed him. \"I told you he never comes down from the Peak unless it's official Iron Lord business. What do you need from him?\"\n\n\"Hey, what're you doing later?\" Wu asked suddenly.\n\n\"Hunting Fallen. They're becoming a problem at Boyle Pass. We'll be at it 'til dusk,\" Efrideet said, lifting the helmet just above her mouth to grab a drink from behind the counter and swallow an entire mug of the malt Wu served. She belched and asked, \"Care to join us?\" Her smile just beneath the helm was all teeth.\n\nWu chuckled. \"Nah, a mere mortal at a Risen fight? I'd just get in the way.\" He thought for a second. \"Would you like to dance before you go?\"\n\n\"Nah,\" she said, imitating his tone. The helm came down.\n\nHe cocked his head over the music, then leaned in to ask, \"Wait, what did you think I said?\"\n\n\"Would you like to dance before you go?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I would love to,\" he said, stepping forward, arms wide.\n\nShe side-stepped him and kicked his leg out from under him. He went tumbling to the ground, and someone spilled their drink on him.\n\n\"I had to try,\" he called from the floor, watching her go. The plume of her helmet rose above the crowd, and was already halfway out the door. \"Take the bodies!\" he yelled, still on the ground.\n\n**\n\nIt took him three hours to climb the Peak that night. He was shivering in his long coat, and if not for his Ghost, he would have succumbed to the cold long ago. Ghost was hidden, of course.\n\nThe massive castle doors were already open when he arrived at the top. An Exo, eyes glowing in its sleek black skull, stood just beyond them. It released whatever weapon it was reaching for inside its greatcoat when Wu Ming approached with his hands held high.\n\n\"I come in peace, brother.\""

        "text": "It wasn't much warmer inside, though Felwinter's Ghost had lit the fireplace for Wu. He sat across from the former Warlord, both of them in massive, gothic chairs.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Felwinter spoke first.\n\n\"Your neighbor. I live downstairs, been trying to get your attention for a month,\" Wu Ming grinned.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nWu thought about it. \"I heard you kill.\"\n\n\"A necessity of life in this post-Collapse existence.\"\n\n\"No, I'm talkin' Risen. Final-deaths. It's gotten real taboo recently. You Iron Lords are changin' things.\"\n\n\"Who are you? I don't believe you've been honest with me.\" Felwinter's voice echoed through the chamber.\n\nWu Ming leaned back and rubbed his temples. His hands shook.\n\nFelwinter stared unblinking. Wu had the feeling the Exo would sit, frozen in time, until he said something.\n\n\"Ghost,\" Wu Ming beckoned. His only friend in the world materialized out of the air.\n\n\"Is that supposed to impress me?\" Felwinter asked without a shred of irony. \"How else would you have survived the climb?\"\n\nWu coughed. Ghost shook its head at him.\n\n\"Let me ask again, then,\" Wu Ming said, straightening to his full posture in the stupid chair. \"Will you break the Iron Decree? Will you kill for real?\"\n\n\"As a Warlord, I did many things I'm not proud of. Under the Iron Lords, I adhere to strict rules of engagement,\" Felwinter said. His voice sounded hollow inside his armored skin. \"Ghosts are not valid targets.\"\n\n\"I heard you care very much about right and wrong, and the delivery of justice to those who deserve it.\"\n\nFelwinter's eyes glowed brighter.\n\n\"I can't think of a more human act,\" he said after a moment's pause.\n\n\"I don't know that anyone has a right to that. But I believe in revenge with all my heart. And I have a request, knowing that you do what you do.\"\n\nFelwinter tapped his chin. \"What are you asking me?\"\n\nWu Ming told him a story about a long-forgotten town far away called Eaton, early in the age of Iron Lords. A Lord called Dryden had brought food for the town's starving people, but in return, asked to use them as bait to bring a local Warlord into position for an ambush. This, Wu had learned, went against the code set out by Lord Radegast, the founder of the order. Dryden had broken the rule of involving Lightless individuals in Iron Lord business, because it was those people the Lords had unified to protect. The town had agreed, of course. What choice did it have? But the ambush had gone horribly wrong. The Warlord target had brought a whole fireteam to the fight. Eaton's erasure was utter and complete. Though Wu later learned that Dryden won the battle, he lost every Lord under his command, Ghosts and all, and he committed the additional sin of inflicting final deaths on the Warlords he defeated, in an act of bloodlust and rage. In the intervening years, Wu had learned that Dryden kept this under wraps, and that he and his Ghost were now among the most decorated of Lords, next to the likes of rising champions like Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet themselves.\n\nFelwinter sat frozen in his chair. It was difficult to tell if he had registered any of what Wu Ming had said.\n\n\"How do I know you're not lying?\" the hollow voice asked finally.\n\n\"I have live recordings,\" Wu replied. His Ghost transmitted a data stream to Felwinter's Ghost, who nodded.\n\n\"Eaton. Who were those people to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just ghosts.\"\n\n\"You want revenge for people you care nothing about?\"\n\n\"Is the Darkhorse of Iron for hire?\"\n\nFelwinter stood, and politely motioned for Wu Ming to take his leave.\n\nWu sighed, shrugged, and left the chamber. He had a long climb ahead of him.\n\nThe Exo parted his coat and drew a long, bronze shotgun from his side.\n\n\"What do you think?\" his Ghost asked.\n\n\"Call Lord Dryden. Prepare my Iron Banner arsenal.\""

Simply another chapter in another story that will bind your legend to those that came before.\n\nRezyl sought to vanquish terrors. Yor fertilized the wilds with suffering and despair that a new hope would grow. I was that hope. My fire showed that whispers could be hushed. To many the legend, and the lesson, ends there. They're wrong. Dangerously so. Yor's true lesson—and by extension Rezyl's—wasn't that strength beats strength. His lesson was far more subtle, and infinitely more grand. Adversity leads to evolution. Forces it. And through that crucible we are remade. Better. Stronger. More than we were.\n\nThe Guardians of today are not gods. Nor where those who came before. We are all simply links on a chain reaching back to the dawn of time, and forward to the end of existence. Each link gaining strength from the others. Each link stronger than the last. Just as I was \"stronger\" than Yor, you are stronger than me. The whole working to solidify the parts and growing sturdier as the harsh truths of reality stretch and strain to break us—to break the chain, sever our individual links.\n\nBut our chain shall never break, because warriors like you and I are not so proud as to forsake our past. We learn from it, grow from it. It is the foundation upon which we build each victory. It is the catalyst for our change. And here, now, I offer you the chance to spark a new evolution—the next hallmark in our betterment, the next leap forward in our war against extinction.\n\nI've held this jagged weapon since that faithful day on Dwindler's Ridge. Kept it hidden away. Kept its secrets, kept its nightmares locked away where none could hear—none could be tempted. It's quiet now, except a low murmur, but its sickness remains. There were countless times I thought to destroy it—remove its threat from the playing field. But I knew it held a greater purpose, and I believe that purpose can be found and fulfilled in your hands.\n\nThe Hive use untold methods to destroy us. The Weapons of Sorrow are but one. The fate of this wicked tool is in your hands now. Will you allow sorrow to linger—a festering threat waiting to consume all who are tempted by its power? Or will you forge a new road? Will you show the Hive and every Guardian who follows in your wake that sorrow does not guide us? I leave those questions for you to ponder, but I know what I believe.\n\nWe are better than our deepest fears.\n\nWe are ever and truly…\n\nWeapons of Light.\n\n—S."

We do not need titles torn from dead fables. We are, and have always been, who we are. Hated. Feared. Lost. Broken. Dredgen Yor did not make us. Orsa and his fools would have us believe we walk in the footsteps of truest, pure sorrow. I say my sorrow equals that of Yor. I say it transcends. I say we are the future, and the future does not wait for failures resting as ash in a field on some lonely, forgotten ridge. The Book says we must be unmade, not remade, not evolved, not improved. Unmade. To achieve such glories, we must start with ourselves. We must look into the abyss, naked and unafraid of its judgment against our many human weaknesses. But Orsa knows this. As did Bane and the others. They fear true judgment. They would hide behind their interpretations of Yor's ancient texts. Seeking understanding as a means to delay what must be done. No more gambits. No more posturing. No more running from a lone man with a Golden Gun. Malphur is not a worthy foe; he is an excuse. No longer. From this moment on, we—those few brave enough to heed my words—will walk a straight line toward the abyss. We will end all who would change our course.\n\nGathering: [cheers]"

        "text": "The Gambit paid off. In more ways than one. The Guardians who joined in the Drifter's games have proven to be the perfect guinea pigs to demonstrate a larger point—the shadows of dark power that tempt us are not inherently evil. In fact, they are simply another tool to be used if we hope to bend the unknown to our will, an impossible feat we must learn to master if we wish to push back the ever-aggressive tide of extinction.\n\nAzzir knew this. Long ago. Long before anyone else, he saw the path forward; he simply didn't understand it. His courage and strength clouded the dangers of the path he tread. The path we now walk. The difference being we have Azzir's folly to guide us. We can, and have, learned from his mistakes. That some level of deceit was needed to further my goal of seeing Azzir's path to the end is... unfortunate. But necessary.\n\nThe stage set by the foul sport the Drifter has crafted has given many Guardians the confidence they need to see the shadows for what they are without losing their way or tainting their Light. This was Azzir's gravest mistake. He plunged freely into the abyss thinking his will alone could fend off the whispers and the corruption. But alone we all fall. Only together can we thrive in light... and dark.\n\nWhich leads to the other need addressed by Gambit's promise. Those Guardians who would give freely of themselves and seek not only power in the shadows, but comfort. Purpose. They have been drawn out and addressed. Some with force and, sadly, an end. Others quickly forfeit their troubling ambitions when faced with the dire truth of the journey they'd begun.\n\nIn the end, many Shadows have fallen. But they have all been false prophets, lost souls who would have fallen to despair sooner or later. Best to tempt them here and now in a manner we can control and correct than to allow the weak-willed to fester within our ranks.\n\n—S."

So too, in time, will yours. I don't know that he ever reflected on his legacy. Truth told, I'd imagine he never considered his own death until after becoming the other—until after becoming Yor. I often wonder if he was aware of the monster he began, or whether even in that twisted, dark, nightmarish form, he still saw himself as the noble warrior—the defending knight giving all of himself to protect his crumbling castle.

This is why I shared my truths with you—my journey, the Shadows, our purpose, our sins. When you sought Thorn, the hated yin to the Word's noble yang, I knew you were headed in a fateful direction that would see me and mine as nothing more than afterthoughts in the wars to come. That I may have served as a catalyst for even a sliver of your continued growth is an honor.

Friend. The true Shadows are no more—only myself, Grey, Maas, Pavic and Yasuul remain, and we take our leave of these wars.

It hurts vaguely, the same way everything does, muffled by too much time and not enough Light.\n\n\"You said that already,\" he tells the hallucination, helpfully.\n\nIt squawks, \"I did? When?\"\n\n\"Last time.\" Or the time before. Chronology is a lost art in this cell. \"Alert, spelunkers contact band two-two-seven dot nine-seven, something something, Skyshock potential…\"\n\nHis voice fades. It hurts to talk.\n\n\"Say again?\" The hallucination has a new voice this time, sharper, male. Nearly Mir-ish. \"The band number?\"\n\nPraedyth rolls back over to face the ceiling, blank as always. He sighs. He's catalogued constellations in its speckles, cats and Ghosts and a squid or two.\n\n\"Excuse me? Whoever you are?\" The first voice is back. \"We're calling from band two-two-seven dot one-seven. If you were contacted by another two-two-seven group, we really need to know.\"\n\n\"You said that last time, too.\"\n\nA third voice interrupts. \"Did the other group use this radio frequency?\"\n\nThey did. Praedyth hasn't had the strength for fiddling with his radio lately, in new attempts to contact the world outside this cell. Hasn't had the strength for much but counting off meaningless intervals of time, waiting for the next window to chance a message.\n\n\"We've tried this frequency at least a dozen times over the past month. It's never worked before.\"\n\nThen what's changed?\n\nThe question shakes him out of his torpor.\n\nPraedyth sits up, a wave of nausea following, and he repeats the question out loud.\n\nMaybe it's not a hallucination. Maybe he's finally breached the walls of the Vault somehow. Maybe he has a chance.\n\n\"Hello? Are you still there?\"\n\nAll he gets back is a wash of static. Whatever signal he was picking up, it's gone."

        "text": "Praedyth has watched from his cell for longer than he knows how to quantify, sitting inside, looking out.\n\nHe's seen so many different timelines. There's no way to know which are real.\n\nFrom a certain point of view, they might all be.\n\nSome things he recognizes. He sees the Traveler often, though he can't feel its Light through the bars of his cage. Sometimes it hangs over a city so familiar it makes his heart ache. Sometimes it hangs in an alien sky, and foreign shapes make airy loops around it—Ghosts of unrecognizable make.\n\nSome visions he gets once, while some come back over and over again. One recurring image: a piece of the Traveler cracked off from its body, lying belly-up in a forest, with a small figure standing in front of it. The figure changes every time, but the sickly glow of the Traveler doesn't.\n\nOnce, he sees a vision of himself. Straight-shouldered, warm in the Martian sun, standing between Kabr and Pahanin. Kabr's helmet is familiar; it's one Praedyth helped make. He was a defter hand with spinfoil lamination than Kabr ever was. Kabr had worn that helmet barely five years into their life as a fireteam, worn it for six straight months, till he cracked it in half in the Crucible. That vision makes Praedyth weep—desiccated as he is, he didn't think he had it in him.\n\nThe Vault shows him Mercury again and again, recognizable only thanks to the scale of the sun in the sky. Sometimes there's rubble hanging in space, a planetary ring still forming. Sometimes there's nothing but rubble, and when he turns, he doesn't see any of the other planets in the system. Gone, somehow, eaten down to the crumbs.\n\nPraedyth wouldn't mind those visions so much if he could only feel the warmth of that colossal sun. His hands are always cold, here in the Vault.\n\nHe sees waves of aliens cross the solar system's threshold, emerging into the light from outside the heliopause. Some of them travel with the air of eager, conquering armies, paint fresh and banners snapping. Some of them move as if they're on the run from something behind them, out in the galactic dark.\n\nHe watches the movements of the Vex. He learns to tell them apart: the shining silver ones, the brass ones with backswept horns, the ones with eyes glowing white. Occasionally, scattered among them are pockets of Vex stained with verdigris, their arms trailing shawls of moss. All the other Vex keep away from those ones. Twice, he's seen other Vex fight the mossy ones. It looks like the other Vex are frightened of them, as much as Vex can be.\n\nSome timelines have veils drawn over them, a darkness too thick to see through. They push back against Praedyth's sight, resisting.\n\nAll the timelines he sees could be true for some living thing. He doesn't know which are true for him. He doesn't know if that's a meaningful question to ask.\n\nHe asks it anyway, and he keeps looking. There's no reason not to.\n\nHe's got all the time in the world."

Not infinite mirrored variations of them from different timelines, but simulations all split off the same base, way back in what must have been the Golden Age. Some have grown far different from their progenitors.\n\nSome have not.\n\n\"We have to base the modifications on the ansible system,\" one Duane-McNiadh says. He's either from 227.13 or 227.204. The voices have been bickering in his ear for what feels like hours.\n\n\"The ansible is a thought experiment! It was proved impossible!\" says another. Some people, Praedyth has heard, are their own worst enemy. In the case of Duane-McNiadh, this might be right.\n\n\"An impossible machine could be the only solution to getting us out of an impossible prison—\"\n\n\"So how do you propose to build it?\"\n\nFinally, a decent question. Praedyth jumps in. \"What materials would we need, hypothetically? We're limited by what I've got with me.\"\n\nHe's in contact with six groups of them, all based in Vex network systems near Venus. They must be within ambit of the Vault's entrance, whatever that means. There are more of them further out both in the solar system and in the Vex information networks: up to two hundred and twenty-one more, apparently. There must be a way to contact them too, to use whatever let them connect with him and go even further, till they can figure out why now and what's happening. What the Vex are doing.\n\n\"What do you have with you?\" That's Maya, Dr. Sundaresh. Brisk. The others listen to her when she speaks.\n\nHe has three guns, two disassembled down to their casings for parts. Two boxes of physical ammo and one of Omolon energy cells he's been using to power his radio. He stripped his armor down long ago; he made a comm unit from his helmet and pulled fine coils of wire from the conductive pads on his gauntlets and steel plating from his boots. In his pockets, he's got lint and the wrapper from a candy Pahanin tossed at his head half an hour before they entered the Vault. It's worn soft and folded into the shape of a crane. No Ghost. Her loss is one thing he has never gotten used to after all this time in the Vault; he still wakes up some days expecting the small weight of her on his shoulder.\n\n\"Anything to etch circuitry with?\"\n\n\"If you give me ten minutes.\" He's got a laser pointer and the focusing crystal out of his Omolon rifle.\n\nWhile he works, all of the Chiomas hold their own discussion.\n\n\"If Praedyth exists physically, even if the space he's in isn't strictly real, he has accesses we don't. And vice versa. Maybe together we can get something to work.\"\n\n\"If you believe his story about the Traveler,\" one of them says, doubtful—227.18's Chioma, more skeptical than the others.\n\n\"I've believed weirder,\" another one of them says cheerfully. She pauses and adds, \"Do you remember the first thing we saw the Vex do?\"\n\n\"Go for Maya's throat?\"\n\n\"No—jump into that frame. Clear through the air.\"\n\nSix Chiomas rattle their fingers against their radios in unintentional polyphony, thinking.\n\n\"Think we're close enough to Vex at this point to use one of their tricks?\"\n\n227.18's Chioma turns wry. \"What's a little more tightrope walking between friends?\"\n\nPraedyth lifts his head from his former laser pointer.\n\n\"How much of a chance does this actually have of working?\" This was Shim, usually the quietest one.\n\n\"Oh, negligible. But it's better than chasing after tech disproved centuries ago.\"\n\nPraedyth doesn't have enough scavenged parts for both trials. It's one or the other, a choice they can't undo.\n\nThey take a vote; Praedyth marks the tally with screws on two adjacent flagstones.\n\n227.18's Chioma gives the first aye.\n\nIt's unanimous.\n\nThey're taking the leap."

Go ahead, use your metaphors: A line. A loop. A flat circle. Heard someone say time was like water once. At least that was novel.\n\nThe Vex, they're the closest to understanding it. They've got distance from it. If time's a river, then we're fish and they're diving birds. What's wet mean to a fish? What's it mean to an osprey, who's never fooled by refraction on the water's surface?\n\nHold on now, you're gonna say. This is getting a bit abstract, even for the bodiless echo of a dead guy in the Garden. You want concrete truths? Something simple, digestible? A story to keep the dark out?\n\nYou want time to be a staircase we keep climbing forever. But hey, even a Guardian skips back a step or two now and then. Die with your Ghost in range, and it'll just pop you back to before that bullet, give you the chance to make a fate you like better. Nothing's been simple on Earth since that big white cue ball rolled in from the next neighborhood over. And the stories, they don't work too well as a night-light anymore.\n\nYou're going to say, but the Traveler is our friend, the Traveler likes us, it gave us a Golden Age and garden worlds and Guardians.

You took my Light already; you'd better take my advice.\n\nI know the Void's still calling. But I've come untethered—I can't reach it any more. So, if I'm right that I can reach you, you keep your ears open. I don't care how much you hate hearing it. This is important.\n\nThe Vex understand time in a way we never will. Doesn't matter how long I spend here watching them. Doesn't matter how many jury-rigged portals Guardians fling themselves through. We live in time. They use it as a tool. Any moment that's ever happened, any moment that will ever happen, they can go back to it. Play it again till they get it right. Simulate it.\n\nThe Light's a counter to that. They come back, a Guardian comes back. They simulate an ending, a Guardian tears through it. Stalemate.\n\nBut the Vex in the Garden? They bend the knee to the Garden's Heart. It gave them power till you got lucky. The Vex outside, they made a different calculation. They run. But the Vex inside make the same deal you make, every day of your unnatural life. And who's to say that deal won't start paying off for them again sometime soon?\n\nYou can't understand the Vex, and you don't want to understand the Heart. But is your ignorance any more forgivable when it's willful?\n\nLots of questions and not a lot of answers. Better take care, or you'll drown in 'em, surely as you'll drown in time, whether it's anything like a river or not.\n\nYou see?"

It has gone through. He whoops raggedly; a dozen Ishtar Collective scientists return the cheer.\n\nThey start to send messages scattershot, wherever they can, whenever the pulses climb high enough to boost their signal. That works for a while. Then the pulses get too strong, strong enough to destroy the integrity of the messages. Instead of skimming along the top, riding the wave, the messages tumble through it and shake apart under its power.\n\nIf they're getting strong enough to unravel data, it could be they're getting strong enough to carry something heavier than a pile of code.\n\nIt's worth a try, Praedyth thinks. Anything is, at this point. Something is coming, a tidal wave's shadow looming over every timeline he can see. Its peak rises sharp over the Earth, breaking the terminator's arc with a deeper darkness. The City can't escape it.\n\nPraedyth carves messages into the last functional pieces of his gear: anything that can serve as a bottle for his messages, thrown out on time's ocean.

You explore. You go on.\n\n227.3\n\nHere's how it goes: you and Maya and Shim and Duane-McNiadh take your first cautious steps out into the Vex information network. You've got to translate everything into metaphor to understand it, here, and this is like doing a Fourier transform on yourself down the blade of a sundial. You fumble a step, and Shim and Duane-McNiadh hoist you back up between them. You come up with a pair of skinned knees, but it's fine. You explore. You go on.\n\n227.218\n\nHere's how it goes: you all take your first confident steps out into the Vex information network. Maya says it feels like trying to get down a mountain on a surfboard. Duane-McNiadh makes grim pronouncements about avalanches, but he does this from a step ahead of you. You're all eager to get started.\n\nYou come to a place that's a simulation of a world you don't recognize—hills rolling with grain that's just faintly iridescent, the color of their stalks an echo of the purple sky. Something in the distance calls out—a bird, maybe. Something that might be the Traveler lies on the distant horizon, a moon-sized eggshell discarded on the ground. It's spiderwebbed with cracks. No light emerges from them.\n\nDuane-McNiadh walks too quickly, not testing the ground. He's gone before you can blink—fallen through an unseen edge of the simulation. When you move to where he disappeared, tilting your head at a certain angle makes the world give itself over to empty black with glowing wireframe edges that don't do anything to illuminate it. Tilt your head back, and there's nothing but purple wheat and the far-off call of an unknown bird.\n\n\"We have to go after him,\" says Maya, \"we can't just leave him—\"\n\nYou're all still shocked, faces drawn. Shim bends for a rock, squints, and tosses the stone underhand at the edge of the simulation. It disappears before it can hit the peak of its arc. He shakes his head.\n\nYou and Maya repeat the experiment, heads cocked like nervy sparrows. When your rocks hit void, they disintegrate first into wireframe and then into that black nothingness.\n\nYou retreat. You put up a marker at the rise of a hill, for all the good it'll do. You mourn. You go on.\n\n227.7\n\nYou lose Shim.\n\n227.33\n\nYou lose Duane-McNiadh.\n\n227.200\n\nThe four of you cobble a radio together to contact the other teams. Every night, when you stop to rest, you click through the channels, hoping another team has had the same idea. On a cliff made of glass, topped with a thin layer of sandy earth and a thinner layer of grass, you get a response that's nearly intelligible.\n\nYou rest the next night at a seashore under the glass cliff. You wake up before dawn at the sound of screaming. You don't have time to find out what's happening before it happens, very finally, to you.\n\n227.72\n\nYou lose Maya.\n\n227.41\n\nYou lose Maya.\n\n227.59\n\nYou lose Maya. \n\nYou mourn. The thought of all the other Mayas out there doesn't help. They weren't the Maya you'd puzzled with over living basalt flowers, a world with seventeen moons, a continent that Shim had sworn up and down was sixteenth-century Australia and that Duane-McNiadh couldn't be dissuaded from calling Pangaea. You'd found a simulation with a city where you discovered a jewelry store, picked out a necklace, brought it home to her, and wished her a happy pseudo anniversary.\n\nMaya didn't like bracelets, said they always fouled her work. Her hair had been getting shaggy again and was due for a trim. She could never decide whether or not to grow it out. She laughed at you lifting weights to maintain simulated muscle, but she spotted for you all the same.\n\nThere are other Mayas out there, layers of them, all the way up to the original, wherever she is. You hope they're doing well. But that doesn't stop you from missing this Maya, missing whatever arguments and discoveries you'd have shared in the rest of the lifetime you'd promised to one another.\n\nShim and Duane-McNiadh pull you up from beside Maya's marker. A basalt lily rests on top of it, petals thin enough to let light through.\n\nYou go on."

He couldn't remember anything, and all he had to go on was the name given to him by a strange, silver drone. A name he didn't even recognize: Felwinter.\n\nAll around him were giant, gilded shelves, half of them broken, littered with tattered books and cracked cylindrical cases. He stepped on a book and broke its spine as he walked. The little drone followed him.\n\n\"I know you don't trust me,\" it said. \"But you have no choice. Who else have you got?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Felwinter said. He thought for a second. \"I don't know anything.\"\n\n\"Exactly. So you should listen to me.\"\n\nThe soaring height of the ceilings made the building feel like an open space. Remnants of an old fresco loomed over his head, cracked and faded. Maybe it was beautiful once. Felwinter trudged through the empty fog of his memory, trying to understand how he got here.\n\n\"You're stubborn, obviously. But if we stay here long enough, you're gonna die.\"\n\nFelwinter tried to tune out the little drone's voice; he needed to think. He picked his way through the ocean of books, but stopped dead when an explosion rocked the building. He looked up. Dust fell from the faded ceiling in clouds.\n\n\"See,\" the drone said. \"This is what I mean. We have to go. A place like this isn't safe.\"\n\nBeside them, a computer terminal—one that looked broken beyond repair—flickered to life. The building shuddered again. A warbling female voice came on over a PA system, crackling and distant: \"Site-wide lockdown initiated.\" Then, a reassuring male voice, smooth, but made eerie by the warped quality of the recording: \"All library patrons please report to the nearest emergency station. If you require assistance, an attendant can help you at the reception de—\"\n\nThe recording cut off and the building shook again. Metal shutters began to descend over the windows, groaning from age and disuse.\n\nSomething big hit the building, and debris showered down over them.\n\n\"We should hide,\" the drone said, and Felwinter had no choice but to agree. They fled the library.\n\nOutside, crouched in the rubble of another building, they watched together as the library was crushed under a torrent of what looked to Felwinter like falling stars.\n\n\"See,\" the drone said."

        "text": "Felwinter and the drone traveled for three days. They saw nothing and no one. On the third night, still walking, Felwinter looked up and saw meteors like streamers against the night sky. He was struck by the sight, and then by one meteor in particular—blazing, orange—getting bigger and bigger in the sky.\n\n\"Run,\" the drone said. \n\nThe first meteor hit the ground behind them. Not a meteor at all, Felwinter realized when he looked back, but something metal, man-made. The second hit its target. He died. Six deaths later, crawling out from under metal wreckage, losing pieces of himself, clawing, running, they finally managed to find shelter in a cave. \n\n\"Nrp,\" Felwinter said, as if he were swallowing all of his words and choking on them. \"Rnnn. Mnnr.\"\n\n\"I can't fix you,\" the drone said after scanning him. \"That last hit corrupted write-protected processes in your cognition modules.\"\n\n\"Nnnr?\"\n\nThe drone spun uneasily. \"You're an Exo. Exos were made in the Golden Age, with proprietary tech. I can't hack into your head to fix the damage, but I can rebuild you as you were. If you shot yourself, I could work quicker.\"\n\nHe did. When the drone resurrected him, Felwinter crumpled to his knees. He sat down and put his head in his hands.\n\n\"Why is this happening?\" he asked. He looked at the drone, trying to read its body language. \"Because of you? It's after you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No,\" the drone said. \"I don't know why.\" Then it gentled its voice, \"The Traveler told me to save you. That something was different about you.\"\n\n\"That ball in the sky you showed me? It talked to you?\"\n\n\"I can't explain it.\"\n\nFelwinter grunted and held his head again. His body ached with the memory of seven deaths, though he knew that was impossible. \"Can you explain anything?\"\n\n\"Not really.\"\n\nThey sat in silence for a while. Eventually, the drone spoke up: \"We shouldn't stay in one place for very long. I don't think it's safe.\"\n\nFelwinter stared at the ground, then finally looked up at the drone. \"How will I sleep?\"\n\n\"You don't need to.\"\n\n\"But I want to.\"\n\n\"That's fine.\""

        "text": "Six months of running taught Felwinter two lessons about life.\n\nThe first lesson was this: Anything could happen at any time, without explanation or reason.\n\nThe second lesson was this: It didn't matter how unfair something seemed. Recognition of injustice could not create a just world.\n\nThere were other lessons, too, though those were more tactical: Never rest in the same place twice, and don't rest at all if you can help it. Never cross an open field if a less-exposed route exists. Beware of meteor showers. Look out for organic enemies, but don't waste your time avoiding them. They aren't the real threat.\n\nThat night, Felwinter and the drone sheltered together in the loft of an old barn. A vicious rainstorm outside impaired visibility enough to justify an overnight, but Felwinter couldn't stop himself from thinking, from assessing. Flimsy building. Big empty field. Low attack readiness in this loft. Flimsy building. Big empty field. Low attack readiness…\n\nAnd still, no matter what the drone said—that he didn't need to sleep—he felt an inexplicable exhaustion. He couldn't locate it precisely. It permeated all of him. The drone noticed. It never said anything, but Felwinter knew it noticed.\n\nHe rested his head on his knees. Beside him, the drone hovered at his shoulder, drifting away occasionally to assess the weather through a glassless window.\n\nEventually, Felwinter raised his head.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked the drone quietly.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Your name,\" he said. \"You gave me one. What's yours?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought about it.\"\n\nSilence fell between them again. They lived in silence. But in recent days, the silence had changed. If before it was the silence of strangers, now it had become the silence of a team, where each member knew their job and what was at stake if they didn't perform.\n\nThe lights of Felwinter's eyes narrowed briefly into lines as he thought. \"Fel…\" He glanced at the drone. \"Spring.\"\n\n\"What?\" the drone said.\n\n\"Felspring,\" Felwinter said. \"That's your name.\"\n\nThey stared at each other.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" the drone said. \"Felspring?\"\n\nFelwinter gazed past her. Silence again.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Felspring."

        "text": "After three weeks without any incidents, Felwinter and Felspring stopped avoiding main roads. They started passing by other traveling parties—even a small camp. They never engaged, until an Exo Risen asked to tag along with them on his way to a place called Red Valley.\n\nNeither Felwinter nor Felspring liked the idea, but they both reluctantly accepted it, with an unspoken agreement between them that it shouldn't last.\n\n\"Nice day, isn't it?\" said Gryphon-11. He looked up at the blue sky and opened his arms. \"Good traveling weather. We're lucky.\"\n\nFelwinter and Felspring exchanged a look, then focused on the road ahead again.\n\nGryphon looked at Felwinter, hoisting his pack up on his shoulder. \"Where are you headed, anyway? You never said.\"\n\nFelwinter took a beat too long to say, \"Not sure.\"\n\nThis stumped Gryphon—inexplicably, Felwinter thought. \"Huh,\" he said. \"Just walking?\"\n\n\"You could come with us,\" said Gryphon's Ghost. She wore a green and yellow shell with flower-like petals.\n\n\"No,\" said Felspring. And then, remembering the world of polite conversation, she added, \"We're going somewhere. We just don't know the name.\"\n\nGryphon and his Ghost absorbed that information, nodding. \"An adventure,\" Gryphon said finally with a grin in his voice. \"Right? This whole world is an adventure, isn't it? And we get a thousand chances to live it.\"\n\nFelwinter said nothing. He felt uneasy. He rarely spoke, but when he did, he never sounded like Gryphon did. His voice never sounded like that. He never even had the impulse to talk that way. Why?\n\nThey walked on, passing through a string of abandoned factories. There was evidence of the Fallen everywhere, but it looked old. Ripped-up banners, trampled in the mud. A Walker stripped of most of its parts. Gryphon loosed his gun from its holster, casually, but didn't break his step.\n\nGunfire stuttered out from an open doorway. A bullet clanged off of Felwinter's shoulder like a clapper off a bell. Arming his rifle, he returned fire in the direction the shots had come from.\n\nHe should have known this was a bad spot. Low visibility. A lot of corners. Squat buildings they couldn't see inside of. Hundreds of rusted shipping containers to hide in…\n\nThe doorway was a decoy. Ten, twenty, thirty armed and armored combat frames with glowing red eyes spilled out of warehouses to their left and right. Moving with discipline and eerie synchrony, the frames began a pincer maneuver, trying to pin them down. Gryphon swore.\n\n\"We have to get to cover,\" Felwinter said.\n\nFighting back to back, rezzing each other when they died, Felwinter and Gryphon took down some 15 frames with gunfire alone, and a few more with grenades. Several got back up despite crippling damage, tottering forward on bent and broken legs, relentless, single-minded. They drew inexorably closer as the two Exos ran down their ammunition and energy.\n\nIt was Gryphon who saved them in the end, with three bolts of Arc Light that erupted out of his hands. As the frames closest to them disintegrated in a shower of blue light, Gryphon whooped and said, breathlessly, \"I've never done that before.\"\n\nFelwinter went to examine one of the (mostly) intact frames. \n\nGryphon followed. \"Damn,\" he blurted. \"Do you know what these are?\"\n\n\"No,\" Felwinter said. Not Exos…\n\nFelspring zipped in between them. She scanned the frame, bathing it in blue light. She hesitated, and then offered, \"Rasputin?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Gryphon's Ghost agreed. \"See this logo?\" She indicated a symbol on the frame's chassis that looked a little like a military badge. \"Matches my database.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Gryphon. He looked at Felwinter. \"What did you do to get a Warmind on your case?\"\n\nFelwinter stared down at the frame. \"What's a Warmind?\""

        "text": "\"I can get it open,\" Felspring said, as Felwinter pried open two rusted metal doors with his hands. \"You don't have to do that.\"\n\nThe metal screamed as Felwinter ripped the two doors back. They were deep underground in a bunker Felspring had struggled for six days to locate. Now that they'd found it, Felwinter realized he didn't know what they were looking for.\n\n\"I don't know very much about Rasputin,\" Felspring said, floating cautiously beside him. \"I thought he was deactivated. Or destroyed in the Collapse.\"\n\nFelwinter walked forward. The room was like a time capsule: untouched, preserved, as if technicians might walk in at any time to work the control panels lining the walls. It reminded him of the library where he'd woken up, just in its complexity and… maybe beauty. Was this beautiful? He wasn't sure.\n\n\"So why would a Warmind be after us?\" Felwinter muttered.\n\nFelspring hovered to examine a flat, black surface on one of the control panels. \"I don't know.\"\n\nFelwinter came up beside her. He hesitated, and then reached to touch the shiny, blank surface of the panel. It blinked to life under his hand, bright code and controls glowing orange, rearranging themselves as he dragged his finger across them.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" Felspring whispered.\n\nFelwinter shook his head. He touched another blank panel and lights came on all over the bunker, waking it up.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said."

        "text": "Warsats and combat frames found Felwinter and Felspring everywhere they went. They weighed the pros and cons and decided that a fortified home base was safer than picking a new, ramshackle camp every time they wanted to rest. It was risky, but so was everything.\n\nSo Felwinter climbed a mountain. At the top of it was a pre-Golden Age observatory they'd found in a map database in a Seraph bunker. It was the perfect place to hide: it had a 360° view of the surrounding area; existing structures that could be fortified; a mountain they could burrow into to hide themselves beneath thousands of tons of rock…\n\n\"He won't find you up here,\" Felspring said. \"Or… at the very least, you'll see him coming.\" She sounded almost hopeful. \"Maybe we could finally stop running.\"\n\nFelwinter looked warily at the sky and said nothing.\n\nThe only problem with the mountain was that it was occupied: a Warlord named Castor had claimed it and the village at the mountain's base. But Felwinter knew that everyone had a price, and he called on Castor to negotiate.\n\nWarlords, he'd learned, were poor negotiators. They were almost never willing to give ground.\n\nIn the end, Felwinter shot Castor's Ghost and pushed him off the side of the mountain.\n\nA month later, during a routine patrol of the mountain's perimeter, Felwinter found a woman sitting on a rock ledge halfway down the mountain. Beside her, there was a wooden crate of sad-looking crops, and another heavy with ammunition. She stood up when he arrived.\n\nFelwinter exchanged a look with Felspring, then asked the woman, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name's Aarthi,\" she said. \"You killed Lord Castor, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you're the lord of this mountain now.\"\n\n\"It's my mountain,\" Felwinter said. \"But I'm no Warlord.\"\n\nAarthi studied him. She had a thin, weathered face and calculating brown eyes. \"My village is down there.\" She pointed down the mountain. \"We need protection. That was Castor. Now it's you.\" She pointed to the crates, as if she were explaining something to a very simple child. \"This is our payment.\"\n\nFelwinter looked at her, then at the crates, then said again, slowly, \"I'm no Warlord. And I don't need your food.\"\n\nAarthi's expression was as blank and unreadable as his own. \"I'll be back next month.\""

She sat next to them, hugging her knees for warmth and looking out at the valley below, until Felwinter came by to retrieve it.\n\n\"I thought this might be more useful to you,\" she said. \"Since you don't want food.\"\n\nFelwinter looked at her, took the crates, and then went back up the mountain.\n\nThe month after that, she brought salvaged weapon parts. When Felwinter came to retrieve them, she watched him until he turned to go, and then said, \"I know about you, you know.\" When he turned around to look at her, she lifted her chin. \"They call you Lord Felwinter. I hear you've killed more Warlords than Castor. Over old technology. From the time before the Collapse.\"\n\n\"Not a Warlord,\" Felwinter murmured, hiking onward.\n\nAarthi watched him, then called to his back, \"Just because you say that doesn't make it true.\"\n\nShe came back the next month, and the next month, and the next. They spoke a little more every time. About life in the village. About what they imagined the time before the Collapse was like. About the future.\n\nThe seventh time he saw her, he lingered a little while. Together, they looked out over the valley beyond the mountain.\n\n\"You could really help us,\" Aarthi said softly. \"All those Golden Age technologies you know so much about. We could live a totally different life.\"\n\nFelwinter stood completely still, looking out over the horizon. \"I can't,\" he said.\n\nShe looked at him, trying to read his expression, and then looked sharply away. They stood in silence for a while. \n\n\"You know,\" she said, pointing down the mountain. \"Warlords have been crashing through our village for ages. Stepping on us. Tearing up everything we plant, tearing down everything we build.\"\n\n\"I'm not a Warlord,\" Felwinter said quietly.\n\n\"Sure,\" she said. \"But you're like them. You get a thousand second chances. You get to live in a big fortress on top of a mountain. What do you think it's like for us? What do you think it's like to have the sky constantly falling down on you?\"\n\nFelwinter stared at her.\n\nAarthi crossed her arms. \"It must be nice,\" she said. Her expression softened; not for him, but for herself. For her people. \"To not have to worry.\"\n\nThe next month, Aarthi didn't come to meet him, nor the month after that."

        "text": "\"Don't understand what you hope to get out of this,\" Felspring said stiffly as Felwinter searched a Seraph bunker. Golden Age weapons of every shape and size lined the walls. Some of them were clearly non-functional from age and disuse. Others looked pristine, save for the dust.\n \n\"If anything,\" she went on, \"you're just putting us back on his radar. When we stayed on the mountain, he stopped bothering us.\"\n\nWhen Felwinter didn't reply, Felspring bunched her shell and asked, more pointedly, \"Is this really because of what she said?\"\n\nFelwinter picked up one of the weapons: a massive grenade launcher. \"Who?\"\n\nFelspring did an incredulous spin. \"Who?\" she said mockingly. \"Who!\"\n\nFelwinter glanced at her, then back at the grenade launcher. He held it up as if he were aiming it at the wall, and then set it aside and went to pick up a scout rifle, examining its scope.\n\nFor a while, Felspring just watched him. Eventually, she flew to his side again and said, \"This isn't what they need, you know.\" When he paused to look at her, she went on, \"Weapons. There's enough of that out there already.\" His expression remained uncomprehending, and Felspring sighed. \"The Golden Age was a time of peace and prosperity.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Felwinter said.\n\n\"They built things. They didn't tear them down.\" At his continued silence, Felspring floated around to his other side. \"Think about it. It was the greatest expansion in humanity's history. Cities sprung up like weeds—impressive cities. And it all happened really fast.\" She paused. \"Huh. Actually, I have no idea how they did that.\"\n\nFelwinter stared at the scout rifle in his hands. \"Labor frames?\"\n\n\"Sure. But even that wouldn't've been enough, and it wouldn't have helped them terraform Titan on their own. They must have had some kind of tech. Something to help them build.\"\n\nFelwinter nodded and set down the scout rifle. \"So where is that technology?\"\n\nFelspring floated over to one of the computer terminals, inspecting the glowing controls. \"That's what I'm wondering, too.\""

One night, they camped in a Seraph bunker and spent hours poring over transcripts of old code.\n\n\"This is weird,\" Felspring said, and projected a display of a long string of code. \"Look. In the Golden Age, Rasputin executes a protocol called SIDDHARTHA GOLEM. No idea what it is. Some kind of knowledge-gathering. It gathers a bunch of transcripts—conversations with Humans, recordings of music, a huge database of literature…\" She whirred and the projection flipped through thousands of words of code, then stopped again. \"Here. Early Dark Age. A submind in Old Russia says SIDDHARTHA GOLEM is active. And gone rogue.\" Her voice dropped. \"Around the time I found you.\"\n\nFelwinter studied the code. It was almost like sight-reading—not quite effortless, but like a native tongue he'd forgotten.\n\n\"But what is SIDDHARTHA GOLEM?\" he murmured.\n\nFelspring zipped back and forth through the code again at a nervous, stuttering pace, then stopped it. Then scrolled through the code again, stopped. Scrolled again, stopped. \"Wait.\" Her voice quivered just a little. \"See that? This is the first time SIDDHARTHA GOLEM is mentioned. It…\" She paused, then went on, quieter, \"It says, 'Initiate SIDDHARTHA GOLEM upload at DSC-342.'\" A beat. \"DSC, Felwinter.\"\n\nFelwinter was silent, thinking, uncomprehending. \"DSC?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\"Deep Stone Crypt.\" She was almost whispering now. \"SIDDHARTHA GOLEM was an Exo.\"\n\nFelwinter looked down at himself, at his hands. He turned them over, studying the worn metal of his palms.\n\nThe silence filled the bunker nearly to bursting.\n\nTo Felwinter, it felt like years until either of them spoke again. The whole time, Felspring watched him, frozen in the air.\n\n\"He's you,\" she whispered."

It was unnerving.\n\nRadegast tipped his chin to Felwinter. \"Timur says you have an interest in the Golden Age.\"\n\n\"In the Warmind,\" Timur said. \"Rasputin.\"\n\nFelwinter said nothing.\n\n\"What brought you to us?\" Radegast asked.\n\nFelwinter glanced at Timur, and then back at Radegast. \"Your friend here told me about the nanotech you're looking for. SIVA?\" He paused. \"It sounds too good to be true. But I want to help you find it.\"\n\nRadegast studied him, and then finally nodded. \"Any civilians on your mountain?\"\n\n\"A little settlement at the bottom.\"\n\n\"We think the mountain would make a good place for our base of operations.\"\n\n\"Funny,\" Felwinter said without any trace of humor. \"I said the same thing to myself, years ago.\"\n\nRadegast snorted. \"So? Would you give up the peak for the cause?\"\n\n\"If I do, do my people get the protection of the Iron Lords?\"\n\nTimur slapped Felwinter on the back—a giant hand hitting an immovable object—and Radegast smiled, just a little. \"Let me take you to Saladin,\" he said. \"He'll tell you about the City.\""

Better for everyone.\n\nIn a bunker on the outskirts of the Cosmodrome in Old Russia, Felwinter browsed through maps of old, deactivated Golden Age facilities, looking for anywhere that might've housed SIVA or SIVA-related research. At the same time, Felspring decrypted and searched old command records for signs of SIVA. By now, they moved like clockwork. It was almost unconscious.\n\n\"Hey,\" Felwinter said. \"Got anything on Site 6?\"\n\n\"Give me the coordinates,\" Felspring said. \"I'll look.\"\n\nAfter a moment, she displayed a section of code for Felwinter to see. \"Research center,\" she said. There was a note of hope in her voice. \"Containment facility for something called AMPHION LYRE. Do you think…\"\n\n\"I feel pretty damn sure,\" Felwinter said quietly.\n\nThey looked at the screen of the console, where a little red light blinked on a map next to the words SITE 6.\n\n\"Come on,\" Felwinter said. \"We have to tell the others.\"\n\nHe committed the map to memory and turned to go, but Felspring zipped in front of him. \"Wait,\" she said. \"Wait a second. Wasn't that kind of… too easy?\"\n\nFelwinter looked around. \"We've been here for hours,\" he said. \"And we've been searching for years.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Felspring said. \"But not as long as it took to find SIDDHARTHA GOLEM. Not as long as it took to get away from him. Compared to all that, this was… too good to be true.\" Felwinter said nothing, and she went on, close to pleading, \"After everything, why would he do this? Why would he just drop this in your lap?\"\n\n\"He didn't,\" Felwinter said. \"We found it.\"\n\nFelspring didn't scare easily, but she sounded scared. \"He let us find it, Felwinter. I'm almost positive.\"\n\nFelwinter shook his head. \"No. We found it.\" He looked at his Ghost. \"If anybody can get Rasputin to cooperate with the Iron Lords, it's us. We know him better than anyone.\" He paused. \"I know him better than anyone.\" He lowered his voice. \"This is it, Felspring. This could change everything.\"\n\nThe little red dot on the map blinked steadily, like a beacon.\n\nThey were still as they looked at each other, waiting. There was no real disagreement here. After all these years together, her doubts were his doubts, and his certainty was her certainty. Whether they liked it or not.\n\n\"Sometimes I wish we'd just stayed on that mountain,\" Felspring said finally. \"Alone.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" said Felwinter, turning for the door. \"But we didn't.\""

We might be walking into a trap set centuries ago.\"\n\nFelwinter stood nearby, arms crossed. \"I've infiltrated Golden Age facilities before. Hasn't been a problem.\"\n\n\"The mortar has barely dried in our City walls,\" Saladin said. \"We've driven the Warlords back, but they are watching. This may not be the time for risk.\"\n\nLeaning with his elbow on the table, Timur looked between them. \"Besides, what about the Warmind? My understanding is that SIVA is under its protection. Perhaps it won't take kindly to thieves.\"\n\n\"We're not stealing anything,\" Felwinter said. \"And I think I can communicate with Rasputin.\"\n\n\"It's a computer,\" Lady Jolder said. \"It'll do what it's programmed to do, no matter how clever your arguments are.\"\n\n\"Rasputin's primary directive is to protect humanity. He'll listen.\"\n\n\"He,\" Timur said, smiling a little. \"So personal.\"\n\nFelwinter looked at him, and then back at Saladin. \"With SIVA, we could build more cities. We could help more people.\" Passion wasn't his strong suit, but he felt it now. More than he ever had before. \"We could create a new Golden Age.\"\n\n\"He's right,\" Skorri said. \"We need a new way to give back.\" She looked between her companions. \"When you go to replant a forest, you don't stop after one or two saplings.\"\n\nThe Iron Lords fell quiet. Jolder was frowning, but frowning meant thinking. Silimar looked worried. Radegast and Timur were on his side, Felwinter knew. But the Iron Lords never did anything without consensus.\n\n\"The Golden Age isn't coming back,\" Saladin said finally. \"But you're right. SIVA could change the lives of the people in the City.\" He leaned forward. \"It feels like a worthy risk.\"\n\nThe others murmured among themselves, considering.

You probably knew that second part, but my Papa says there were probably lots of different intelligent species where you come from, so I wanted to be specific. \n\nWhere are you from, by the way? I'm from Mars. But right now, me and my Dad are on our way to join my Papa at a brand-new colony on Europa! Papa is the lead quantum engineer at BrayTech, which basically means he builds super-cool computers. He's so good at it, he gets to work with the Clovis Bray on all the top-secret stuff. He even designed some of Rasputin's hardware! \n\nI hope he shows me what he's working on. He used to do that, back on Mars. \"It'll be a good learning opportunity for you,\" he'd say, \"But only if you promise not to tell anyone.\" And I never have. Even though my friends back home bugged me about Papa's work all the time. \n\nMy old home, I mean. Soon Europa will be my home, and you'll be my new next-door neighbor over on Io! I wish we could pass by you on the way so I could see you up close, but Eventide (that's the colony) needs supplies and Dad is supposed to start working right away. \n\nHe's a psychologist. I don't really get what he'd even do for BrayTech. All he does is ask people how they're feeling over and over again. Maybe they need him to train a Warmind like Dr. Ana Bray did. Only instead of language, he'll teach it how to analyze its dreams. \n\nDad always teases Papa that a human brain is a lot harder to work with than a hard drive. Maybe Papa got him on one of his projects to finally prove him wrong. \n\nWhat do you have: a hard drive or a brain? Are you an AI like Rasputin? Have you ever talked to him?\n\nSorry if these questions are nosy. Dad says I'm super curious and that's okay, I just need to learn when to stop asking questions. Which is pretty unfair since he gets to ask me stuff all the time. Like right now, he asked what I'm writing. So I better encrypt this real quick and go. \n\nI'll write more later.\n\nYour friend, \n\nMicah"

The suits are super chunky and hard to walk in, but Papa says there's an extra-thick lining on the inside to protect against the bad ions bouncing down from space nearby. Plus it helps keep us warm. Did you know that at night, it can get as cold as 140 Kelvin? \n\nI wonder why Clovis Bray chose to build Eventide here, when you're over there terraforming Io? Even if you're not finished, it's probably way nicer…\n\nStill, I'm glad we're here. Seeing Papa again made me so happy I almost cried. (I didn't though.) Once, on the way here, I forgot what his face looked like. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't see it in my mind. It was awful. \n\nHe's grown a beard, so he looks different now. I like it, but Dad said he feels like he's kissing a polar bear. Papa said Dad'll grow a beard too once he discovers how much warmer his face will be. \"Soon you'll have two polar bears for parents, Micah!\"\n\nFor now, I've got a penguin. A plushie, not a real one. I'm too old for plushies, but Papa told me it's from Clovis Bray. \"A souvenir for your soon-to-be arctic adventures!\" Plus it came with this mini version of an ion-shield snowsuit, like the one I have to wear. \n\nIt actually looks pretty cool, so I think I'm going to keep it. \n\nDo you know about polar bears and penguins? Back before you came, they lived on Earth's two poles that had climates a lot like Europa's. But our technology was so inefficient, it was poisoning Earth's air and killing off whole species of animals and plants. Like the opposite of terraforming. \n\nI'm gonna name this penguin Mihaylova after the scientist-aeronaut on Ares One. Do you remember meeting her and Hardy and Qiao? Can you see their faces in your mind?\n\nThat was a long time ago, way before I was born, but you've been around so long, human years must feel like a minute to you. If that's true, then expect to see me (except grown up with a beard) on Io one second after you get this. \n\nI'm still not sure how I'm gonna send my letters to you yet. Maybe they'll let me use a Warsat. I know those are really for high-level threats and stuff, but how many of those can there be? This is a Golden Age. \n\nYour friend, \n\nMicah"

Because of the snow and the danger from bad ions in the air, almost the whole colony is packed into this one underground building. The only people that get to go outside without special permission are the maintenance people and the Exos.\n\nOh, right! I can't believe I didn't talk about the Exos! They did it, Clovis Bray and Papa and all the BrayTech scientists made real walking, talking, human-shaped AIs! \n\nI even got to see one when Papa was giving us a tour of the colony! It looked so cool and shiny. It even had these awesome glow-lights for eyes! I wanted to talk to it, but Dad said I couldn't be trusted not to ask too many questions, so he went over on his own. Papa told me that's why Dad is here: to talk to the Exos and analyze their \"human-ness.\" \n\nHe also said he thinks I can be trusted, especially when it comes to keeping my excitement to myself. Some people are scared of the Exos. Which I don't get. How can anyone be anything but amazed by them? \n\nPapa laughed when I asked him that. \"You're like me. Always seeking out the new and interesting. We forget to fear what we don't know.\" \n\nBut he didn't laugh long before he got serious. \"Sometimes that can get us into trouble. That's why we have people like Dad to balance us out.\" \n\nThat's when Dad came back, looking kinda worried. He wouldn't tell us anything because of \"doctor-patient confidentiality.\" Which is annoying. That's what he always says! Except this time it doesn't make sense because they're not real patients.\n\nBefore I could point that out, Papa asked if I wanted to peek inside the factory. Which, of course, I did. So we went around to the loading bay to look. I couldn't see much, but it was still cool.  \n\nThis is all supposed to be secret, but I think it's okay if I tell you.

Luckily, I have Mihaylova the Penguin to keep me company while I walk aaaaalll the way to the other side of the building for school. \n\nIt's not a school, really. Classroom is more like it. There's only 50 of us kids, so they shoved us all in one room with two teachers, which is how I found out that everyone got a penguin plushie. I feel dumb thinking I was the only one, but also, it's kinda dumb of Clovis Bray to assume babies and big kids would want the same toy. Some of the older kids threw theirs in the recycling chute, but I managed to rescue one. I think I'll call this one Calumet. That's the aeronaut you didn't get to meet because she died on the way to Mars. \n\nThat's the one thing that scares me. Not the Exos or anything else I don't understand. Dying right before a new discovery. Doing all the work to lead up to something new… then bam!

As long as they keep on top of caring for them… but I guess eventually, their hard drives would get erased by cosmic rays. Papa says that doesn't happen for thousands of years. Plenty of time for backups. \n\nLast night, I dreamed I was an Exo. I was standing in the center of a frozen lake in the middle of the night, with no snowsuit, and I didn't feel cold at all. The sky above was completely black, except for one bright moon in the distance. Just as I was looking up, wondering what to do next… Dad woke me up. \n\nAt first I was mad, but he reminded me that dreams are messages from deep inside our minds.

That's what our teachers said anyway. I bet they were just as sick of being stuck inside as we were.\n\nWhile we put our ion-shield snowsuits on, the teachers lectured us about staying in sight with a buddy. But of course, when we got outside, everyone went running in a bunch of directions. That's when I decided I'd learn more useful stuff over at the Exo factory with Papa and Dad. I didn't break the rules. The factory was in sight, plus I had two buddies: Mihaylova and Calumet. \n\nI knew I couldn't go in the front door without a badge. So I went around the side to the loading bay where there were two Exos unloading a bunch of crates. They looked like they were almost done, so I hid under the dock to wait for them to leave.\n\nInstead, I heard one of them sit down. \"I'm taking a break. Need to or not, this is when we used to have lunch. I refuse to work through lunch.\"\n\nAnd the other one said, \"I miss lunch. I miss getting hungry.\" \n\nThen the first one replied with this weird tone, \"Hmm… so you would say… you're hungry for hunger?\" Which made them laugh for a long time. \n\nWhen they finally stopped, the second Exo said, \"What do you tell that shrink, by the way? You tell him about the whisper?\"\n\nThat's when I wanted to leave. I didn't like them making fun of Dad. Plus, the way they talked about food and dreams… it made me feel sick. So sick that I guess I made a noise because then I heard, \"What was that?!\"\n\nSo I ran. \n\nI heard shouts behind me, footsteps catching up, a bang and a sizzle right over my head.

I mean, I was more scared of getting in trouble than anything else. But looking into those eyes was…\n\nSpooky. Almost like being somewhere so dark you can't see your hands in front of your face, though you can feel they're there.\n\nI couldn't look away, even as I heard the other one asking what they should do with me. If it'd be easier if I just went missing.\n\nThen all of a sudden, its eyes went dark, and I fell to the ground. A second later, it collapsed in a sparking metal heap next to me. \n\nI must've started running again. The next thing I remember was coming back to the empty classroom, holding Mihaylova and Calumet, and looking at the penguins that got left behind. Some of them were lying on the floor!  \n\nFor some reason, that made me mad. Maybe I'm too old for plushies, but at least I take care of mine. So I picked out the ones that looked lonely and ran home across the building to hide them under my bed. Then I went back outside to find my class, just as the teachers were counting everyone up. \n\nNo one had even noticed I was gone.\n\nWhich means they don't know who took the penguins either.

In fact, I'll bet my life on it.\" \n\nDad said that's what he was worried about. \"I love you, but forget about being safe in 50 years. Micah needs to be safe here and now.\" He said some of the colonists were going home with the next supply ship. He hoped Papa would join us.\n\nPapa started crying then. I got back into bed and piled all my penguins on my head to block it out. It didn't really work because then I started crying, too. \n\nWhat's going to happen?\n\nMicah"

        "text": "Dear Traveler,\n\nThis will be my last message to you. Maybe you won't see any of these messages anyway. Even if I knew how to now, I'm not sure I'd send them.\n\nI'm not sure about a lot right now. \n\nThe next day was pretty normal. Papa made breakfast and walked me to school, which he's never done before. I think he was worried I heard their fight, because he said he was sorry for working so much. Then he asked if I liked it here. I didn't really know what to say, so I said yes, but I missed Mars. I think that still made him sad, because he said he was sorry again and said he'd spend less time at work. \n\nDad's been working even more. At first, I thought that meant he'd changed his mind about leaving. But now I haven't seen him for a whole week and my stomach won't stop hurting.\n\nWhat has stopped is the dream. Two nights ago, I finally broke away from Europa's gravity. As I floated to you, the whisper followed: \"Are you sure you know what you think you know?\"\n\nI woke up before I got close to you. And last night, I didn't dream at all, which must mean I figured out the message. But all I have are these words stuck in my head. \n\nAre you sure you know what you think you know?\n\nThis morning, Papa told me Dad's been sleeping at the factory because he's so busy, but soon he'll get a break. \"And then we'll spend the whole day together as a family.\" \n\nI'm not sure, but I think he's lying. \n\nTomorrow, the supply ship leaves for Mars and I want to go. So I've packed my bag and once Papa goes to sleep, I'm going to put on my snowsuit and go out to find Dad. I don't care if I run into a whole army of Exos. \n\nMaybe I'll take Mihaylova out of my bag and carry her. For extra support. That's probably dumb, but… \n\nI don't really know what else to do.\n\nGoodbye, \n\nMicah"

Too thick to breach, supposedly. We'll see if it crumbles under the weight of the Vex.\n\n\"You're worried they'll get in here.\"\n\nIt's almost like he can hear what I'm thinking… Then again, who knows what kinda dirty tech he put in our heads?\n\n\"There are only two places on Europa I built to be impenetrable, and this room is one of them. Stop worrying, and activate the new model,\" he says.\n\nHe's breaking protocol again. Every Exo and human in this room can see it. \"Dr. Bray explicitly stated we were to wait for her return—\"\n\n\"I am the only Dr. Bray you take orders from now. We have to assume Elisabeth is dead.\"\n\nThe talking robot head is just as cold as the old man was. What else would you expect from the psycho who died and made himself into an all-seeing AI? Here's to hoping the unconscious Exo in front of us is nothing like the real thing.\n\n\"Now activate him immediately, or I will promptly deactivate you.\"\n\nOkay, okay. I trigger the Awakening Protocol. The Exo's eyes light up. It's confused. I remember that feeling. Who am I? Where am I? Where'd my skin go? At least we woke up with protocols in place. This guy's entering a war zone. Can't be pleasant.\n\n\"Who am I? Where am I? Am I… metal?\" the new guy asks. Called it. The AI takes the lead.\n\n\"The answers to those questions are rather complicated, and our usual methods of easing you into this reality are not currently at our disposal. So I will attempt simplicity in my responses.\"\n\nThe AI goes on to quickly explain where we are, what Exos are, how they work, and why they're important.\n\n\"…And once you've completed your training, there will be a shiny new toy waiting for you to commemorate your accomplishment. Why? Because you're special. Unstoppable. A fighter and an intellectual—better than the rest. Nothing in the whole universe will be able to stop you,\" the AI finishes.\n\n\"I see. That sounds… good. And who… what are you?\" the new guy asks.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked. I'm Clovis Bray. And you and I are—\"\n\n\"Why is he awake?\" a voice demands.\n\nDr. Bray—she's alive! Came in through the tunnel. This should be good.\n\nA couple Exos trail behind her: Noe-2 and Mia-9.\n\n\"I thought you'd died, Elisabeth,\" says the AI, \"So I asked Wen-1 here to wake him up.\" Dr. Bray flashes me an angry look. I ought to unplug the AI bastard.\n\n\"So you broke protocol,\" she says.\n\n\"I put the protocol in place, Elisabeth. I can break it. I only need someone I trust to initiate the signal.\"\n\nI can sense Dr. Bray's frustration. \"The Vex are everywhere. We should be evacuating Europa. There's a group of survivors pinned down in Bunker E15. I need help rescuing them.\"\n\n\"That can wait. I've equipped Charon's Crossing with an advanced signaling technology connected to the Warmind and his bunkers. If we match that to the communication signal used by the Vex, we could theoretically lead them off-world and salvage what we've built here. But the Vex have cut off internal communications channels and Cloud Memory Collection. You'll need to do it manually, Elisabeth,\" the AI says.\n\n\"That'll lead the Vex straight to Mars. Earth. You've said it yourself: the Vex desire only annihilation. You're talking about billions of lives lost. I'll play no part in that,\" she says.\n\n\"My sweet naive granddaughter. Humanity never stood a chance against the Vex, and those lives are expendable. Besides, each one lost is an Exo gained. Another soldier to fight against the Vex. The future is Exo. It's Bray. Our legacy—that's all that matters,\" the AI replies. The new guy's listening in. He may be a bit of a blank slate, but he's not digging any of this.\n\nDr. Bray's jaw is clenched something fierce. Looks like she's gonna attack. I don't blame her.\n\n\"Perhaps our legacy should be burnt to the ground,\" she says.\n\n\"Elisabeth… are you planning to activate the Morning Star?\"\n\n\"Once I get everyone I can off-world, I'll do whatever I have to. We won't lose any more lives over this.\"\n\nHell yeah, lady.\n\n\"Everybody, listen up. Exos and able-bodied humans—I need you. Grab any weapons you can, and let's go,\" she says. We're all in. Weapons in hand, we start piling into the tunnel. Even the new guy, but Dr. Bray's not about it.\n\n\"Hold on there. You haven't gone through any initiation protocols. You're not ready,\" she says.\n\n\"If there are lives to be saved, that's where I need to be,\" the new guy replies. He's oddly determined.\n\n\"Where you need to be,\" the AI interjects, \"is with your family. Me.\"\n\n\"Every instinct I have is telling me to reject you,\" the Exo retorts. Nice, new guy.\n\nI bet if Dr. Bray could smile, she'd be doing it right now. She grabs a gun out of a cache and tosses it to the new guy. \"Perhaps you're ready after all,\" she says. New guy stands steady. Handles the weapon well. He's definitely ready for this; protocols be damned.\n\n\"Elisabeth,\" the AI says. He wants the last word. As usual. \"I will protect our legacy.\"\n\n\"That makes two of us,\" she says and closes the tunnel door behind us.\n\nBadass."

Shards of Exos rain down on us.\n\nThey just keep coming. No end in sight. I'm firing every last bullet I have, but it's not enough.\n\n\"Ruiz—shut it down, now!\" Dr. Bray yells.\n\nHe isn't shutting anything down. He's just a mangled corpse now. Dr. Bray sees it.\n\n\"Evacuate immediately! Go, go, go!\" she shouts as she and a few others run, barely escaping.\n\nI try. I run as far as I can, but it's no use. They're on me now. Ripping out my arms. Pinning me to the floor. This is it for me. Maybe I'll be brought back as Knox-5. But if not? Well…\n\nI close my eyes. A woman smiles at me. She's cooking pierogis. Must be Mom.

She's got a plan to stop it but won't pull the trigger until we're all safe. I admire her.\n\nWe had some bad news of our own to give in return. We tried to evacuate everyone in the Bunker E15, but it was too late. Vex had killed everyone in there. It was… horrific. RIP, friends…\n\nDr. Bray says she's forming a plan to reach the evac ships, but she's been sitting in silence for the last five minutes. I think she's feeling guilty. For not getting back to the bunker in time. Or maybe she's thinking about how this whole Vex takeover is partly her fault in the first place. Facilitating the forages to Volantis. Killing countless Vex.\n\nIf only she knew the truth. What Clovis did to her. I've been dying to tell her. But I haven't. Because, well, I didn't want to end up like her. But I can barely stand it. We were friends. Good friends. Now she only knows me as Reba-3.\n\nOh, here she goes.\n\n\"Listen up, everyone. The Vex have to be in the tunnels by now. So we're going by foot in the snow to get to the ship. Our destination is 55°52 N, 44°11 W, in case you get lost.

Vex after Vex, sliced through like butter, that Sword of his wailing like a banshee seeking vengeance, carrying the weight of thousands of lost souls.\n\nIt seems like a pain lingers inside Clovis-1. As if he fights not just for those we've lost, but to fill a void that was occupied by fear in a previous life. Likely the same fear that brought every one of us to Europa and opened the very gates of hell.\n\nThat void begins to fill once again, this time not with fear, but with love.\n\nDr. Bray stands valiantly alongside him, rifle in hand, leading the charge with ferocity and strength of will.\n\nThese are the leaders we needed. Leaders guided by hope.\n\nWe fall. We rise.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nWe fight alongside them. Those of us who can make our way across Europa and into the Glassway where the portal resides. We fall. We rise.\n\n11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.\n\nOver and over, we fight. We fall. We rise. Rinse and repeat.\n\n21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.\n\nEvery time, we get a little bit closer. Every time, more and more Vex bodies pile up. It infuriates them.\n\nThey flow faster, they fight harder, the numbers increase. They know now what we're after. They throw everything at us.\n\nBut Clovis-30 and Dr. Bray are unrelenting—Sword slicing effortlessly, stroke after stroke. Rifle blaring like thunder, bullet after bullet. We fall. We rise.\n\n31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.\n\nThe constant reboots aren't without sacrifice. A number of memory banks begin to fry from rapid overuse. A few of us are never coming back. We know this. We rise.\n\n41, 42, 43.\n\nWe finally make it to the inner chamber of the Glassway, where the portal resides. It's barely visible, blocked by the horde of Vex that defend and pour from it.\n\nIn the midst of it all is a giant Vex, the one Dr. Bray told us about. A floating doomsday Vex with the wraparound shield that resembles a Hydra.\n\nThere is no fear in their faces. In the midst of all this, the two Brays stand strong.\n\nThey rally the few of us that remain. Lead us towards a task far beyond daunting. One that should by all rights be impossible.\n\nBut they show us the truth. That with enough courage and compassion, anything's possible. Together, they're the lament that carries the voices of every soul lost to these mindless machines.\n\nWith Clovis-43's final strike, the blade shatters into pieces. He doesn't care—the deed is done.\n\nAs the final piece of that monstrous Hydra hits the ground, we burst into cheers. The very few of us that remain. Dr. Bray lets me do the honors. After all, I was there when this all started.\n\nThe command runs. The portal shuts off. We did it.\n\n\"And now, we destroy it,\" Clovis-43 says. He wants it gone for good.\n\n\"No,\" Dr. Bray says. What? I thought she would agree.\n\n\"You know what this did. It has to go.\"\n\n\"Clovis. You, me, and every other Exo… we deserve the life we were promised. If this portal falls, and we die, we lose that life. And if we're gone, and the Vex find some other way back, humanity is doomed. So, let's shut it down. Hell, let's swallow the damn key. But the portal stays.\"\n\nClovis-43 sighs. \"I hope I don't live to regret this.\"\n\n \"Same goes,\" she says sincerely."

Through those doors.\"\n\n\"He's through those doors.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" I pat her on the shoulder before we walk inside to find the Clovis AI all alone.\n\n\"If it isn't the saviors of Europa. Done cleaning up the rest of the colony?\" the AI asks.\n\n\"Just about,\" I say, nodding to Elsie. The AI knows what's coming.\n\n\"You don't have to do this, Clovis-1.\"\n\n\"It's 43, now. And my name isn't Clovis. Not anymore,\" I say and look to Elsie. \"Do the honors?\"\n\n\"Gladly.\" She steps toward the main console. Scans in.\n\n\"But I—\" he tries to plead. We're not letting his snake oil words land on slick ears ever again.\n\nShe enters a series of complex code into the console. Then says the final magic words. \"Deactivate artificial intelligence.\"\n\nThe light in the giant Exo's eyes goes out. If Elsie could smile, I know it would be huge.\n\n\"Well then,\" she says, \"can we finally get off this icy hell moon?\"\n\nNot quite yet. \"I've got one last request.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"You're sure about this? \"This is the last of the radiolarian fluid, you know,\" she says.\n\nMany of the souls we lost at the hands of the Vex and the terror of Clovis were gone for good. But we managed to bring a few back. Got them all off-world. Now it's just us. Soon to part ways forever.\n\nI get her apprehension. Elsie finally gets a grandfather worth her time, and now I'm about to get a fresh reboot. She deserves to know why.\n\n\"When we added Bank E1-815 to your current imprint, all those memories came back to you. About your family. Sisters. Brother. Mother and father. About the pain. The loss. The guilt.\"\n\n\"Yeah…\"\n\n\"Elsie, I caused that.\"\n\n\"You're not him.\"\n\n\"I'll always be the ghost of him. No matter how hard we try to ignore it. And you… you deserve to be free from that person.\"\n\nShe bows her head, which tells me she agrees. It pains me to no end. There was a world where we were a happy family. This isn't it. We both know it.\n\nI place a tablet in front of her.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"It's his journal. Yours if you want it. Lock it away if you don't. It's mostly encrypted, anyway. I read a bit. The kind of person I was… fear driven. Obsessed with legacy. I won't become that. Not again. It's time for you and your siblings to rebuild the Bray legacy the right way. Or tear the whole damn thing down.\"\n\nI can see how badly she wants to. Maybe she will someday.\n\n\"All right then,\" she says.\n\nI don't really know how to say goodbye. But she does. She pulls me in for the first hug I've ever had. Holds me tight. We share the moment. A reverie of what could have been. A passing glance through the looking glass.\n\nWish I could shed a tear right now. Doesn't matter—I feel it anyway. She does too.\n\n\"Do me a favor?\" I ask.\n\n\"Anything.\"\n\n\"That nickname the other Exos gave me… add it to my imprint? With my number?\"\n\nShe laughs. It's good to hear it one more time. \"You really like it, don't you?\"\n\n\"It's growing on me.\"\n\n\"Okay then, Banshee.\"\n\nI step into the pod. Doors close. I give her a little wave.\n\nLet's see what 44 has in store."

        "text": "Another sleepless night. Not that I require sleep, but it helps me to feel normal… whatever that is. I hear shuffling outside. Probably a rat scrounging for food. Good luck. \n\nI'm sick of always having to search for a safe place to rest, though everyone's displaced these days—since the Last City fell. \n\nI hear the noise again. Louder. Someone's near.\n\nBefore I have the chance to move, they're at the head of my cot.\n\nI swing off of the taut fabric, grab my weapon from the floor, and then roll across the room, blasting Stasis at my assailant. They dodge it entirely, leaving my bed momentarily frozen in time. I fire off rounds, grazing their shoulder. \n\n\"Elsie! Wait!\"\n\nNo one calls me that. Except her.\n\nThe attacker removes her hood. She's changed; a bit worse for wear, but it's her. My stubborn sister.\n\n\"What were you thinking, Ana?! Why did you attack me?\" \n\n\"You attacked me!\"\n\nIt's been years since I've seen her, after the Bombardment. Last family reunion didn't end well. \n\nA crimson line rolls down the length of her arm. \"You're wounded.\" \n\n\"It's nothing. I'll be fine.\" \n\n\"You're not fine. Where is that annoying gnat? Why isn't it fixing you?\"\n\n\"I said it's nothing.\"\n\nSomething's up. I stare through her until she offers an explanation.\n\n\"She's… gone,\" Ana admits begrudgingly. \"Let's leave it at that.\" \n\nI'm not surprised to hear this.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Ana?\"\n\n\"I need you to teach me… show me how to use Stasis, like you. You really understand how to control it. You're not corrupted… like them.\" \n\nShe sounds desperate. That's a bad sign.\n\n\"We've been over this. My answer remains no,\" I say. Ana is smart but too easily lead astray. It's a miracle she ended up how she did. I can't get involved.\n\n\"Every day, I make it by the skin of my teeth. Without the Light, without the Traveler, I'm a sitting Dreg, just waiting to be picked off.\"\n\n\"I have bigger concerns.\"\n\n\"Than family?\" she asks, trying to pull my heart strings. \n\nWon't work. I pick up my bag and head out the door.\n\n\"You're just going to leave? Fine. I'll find someone else to help me learn Stasis, so I can take down Savathûn.\"\n\nAre things really so bad for her that she has this death wish?\n\n\"You know what she did, Ana. Stasis won't save you. This is a suicide mission.\"\n\n\"There are others out there who are tired of living in fear too. We can find them.\"\n\n\"Good. Go talk to them instead.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. We can attack with the Light and Darkness. Together.\"\n\n\"Or we can keep our heads low and move on.\"\n\n\"There's nowhere else to go! You want to run away—that's your choice. But I'm telling you we can do this,\" she says and holds up a satchel, pulling a drive from it. \"We just need a little help.\"\n\n\"You… have him?\" I ask in disbelief.\n\n\"What's left of him.\"\n\nThe Warmind. I guess he didn't vanish with Mars. There is power there, but this is still a foolish plan. Although Ana seems hell-bent on learning Stasis and, with Rasputin, she'll do it. Once she puts her mind to something, there's no stopping her.\n\nI always thought the best way to protect her was to stay away from her. If I push her away now, can I really say I'm doing it for her?\n\n\"Only trouble is, he's stuck on this drive…\" she says knowingly. \"He could use a new vessel.\"\n\nAna smiles at me coyly. She knows exactly what to do and just how to bait me. I cast out a million second thoughts. \n\nI can't let my sister get herself killed.\n\n\"Lead the way.\""

        "text": "\"Stay ready. We don't know what's in there,\" I say to Ana, standing in front of the entrance to the Deep Stone Crypt.\n\nWe make our way through the war-torn lab. Eramis's siege before the Bombardment sure left its mark on the place. She found Darkness here and helped spread it like a plague on the world. Clovis almost did the same in his time.\n\n\"If I remember right, we have a long drop ahead of us. You better hang on to me,\" I say.\n\nShe wraps her arms over my shoulders, and it's the first time I've been close to a person in over 100 years. I can smell a trace of sodium tallowate. But only a trace. She hasn't bathed for a few days. She squeezes tight. I forgot what this felt like. My body produces a fleeting sensation of warmth. \n\nI move down the elevator shaft. We land as quietly as possible, remaining still. It's dead down here, but the power is on. Someone must have been here… or still is.\n\nAs we make our way through the eviscerated research center, I notice Ana taking it all in. She seems almost familiar with the space. \n\n\"Clovis was an animal, sure. But what he discovered and built is absolutely incredible,\" she breathes. \n\nNever heard her speak so highly of the old man. She forgets that I was there. Doesn't realize the hand he played in our future, even centuries ago.\n\n\"This way!\" she calls out, running ahead. After walking through several corridors, we come to a familiar dead end. It's still there. Clarity Control. I dreaded seeing this again. Practically a standing testament to all the bad that Clovis did. \n\nI want to get away from it, but Ana's fixated. \"Hey, you ready? We need to keep going,\" I say. \n\nShe snaps back to reality. \"Sorry.\"\n\nFinally, we find it. The place where Exos were born. Ana covers her nose as we're greeted with a rotten smell. Slowly, we turn the corner and see a decomposing corpse desperately clinging to a lever on a console. \"The Drifter…,\" Ana says. Hard to tell how long he's been here. We pry his hand from the console and carry him out of the room to try and purge the stench. \n\n\"What do you think he was doing here?\" I ask.\n\n\"Most likely the same thing we are,\" Ana says, plugging in her drive. \"But he failed. Probably for the best. He doesn't deserve another chance.\"\n\nIt's depressing, seeing him like that. All alone down here…\n\nAna works the console. \"Uploading now. Should be out of here soon. Grab that lever.\" \n\nI pull down, and a latch opens, releasing radiolarian fluid into an empty pool nearby. I catch Ana staring at the spot where we found the Drifter's body.\n\n\"You ever think about what we could have done differently?\" she poses.\n\nAll the time. \n\n\"Not really,\" I answer.\n\n\"So much of this death and destruction stems back to us, to our family. I know Clovis was responsible for a lot. He had a hand in bringing the Darkness to this world.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" I ask.\n\n\"I found a journal the last time I was here. It's old, and half the pages were torn out, but it had a lot of information about him that was salvageable.\"\n\nOf course, she's been here before. Clearly, she's not telling me the whole truth.\n\n\"What else was in it?\" I ask.\n\n\"Outside of the redacted memos and experiments, there were stories and recollections of our family. It's all from his perspective, so he was never the villain. But still, maybe he wasn't as bad as we thought. He seemed to care about us, in his way.\" \n\n\"Really?\" \n\n\"He did some good, Elsie.\" \n\n\"I was there, Ana. I saw the things he did. He was delusional. Of course, he was never the villain in his own story.\"\n\nWe sit for a while and wait in silence. \n\nThe pool begins to bubble. Ana jumps to her feet as a sleek metal hand emerges from the fluid. Slowly, the Exo rises. Silky liquid drips from the tendrils that conjoin the parts. Eventually, it takes its first steps out of the pool. \n\n\"Red?\" Ana asks timidly. \n\nIts head turns. Glowing eyes of scarlet meet ours, and it speaks… Russian. \n\n\"Welcome back, old friend,\" Ana says. \n\nWe're in business."

        "text": "I keep thinking about the Drifter in the basement of the Deep Stone Crypt and wondering when that will be me. Would I have ended up dead, alone and rusting away, if Ana hadn't found me?\n\nThe Last City looks worse than I remembered. Buildings leveled and edifices stripped of their vibrancy pollute what was once the last vestige of hope humankind had. The commerce, the children, the bustling life—all gone. Difficult to think about that day. The Bombardment. We were hit on all sides. Eramis, the Cabal, Savathûn, all attacking our strongholds at once. We never recovered. When the Dark Guardians turned on Eramis and the Cabal, everyone who wasn't killed went into hiding. \n\nRasputin says something in Russian that I miss, and Ana laughs. Is that what it's like to be with friends again, I wonder, as I stare off at the empty sky where the Tower once stood.\n\n\"You were close with the Vanguard, right?\" I ask.\n\n\"I don't know if I'd say 'close.' We had a working relationship. They trusted me.\"\n\n\"Still, must have been nice. Closest thing to a family.\" \n\n\"If Zavala could hear that…\" she trails off. A pensive expression rounds out the lines on her face. \"What was ours like? Our family… before all this.\"\n\n\"Didn't your research tell you, Ana?\"\n\n\"You were with them… with us. You know what they were really like.\"\n\n\"I don't know. We were a family.\" \n\n\"Can you just try a little, for me? You know I don't remember anything. You got to spend time with them. You must be able to tell me something. Anything. What did Mom's hair smell like? What was Dad's favorite song?\"\n\n\"I don't… remember everything. Clovis made sure of that.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what you do know,\" she pleads.\n\n\"I don't want to have this discussion.\"\n\n\"You don't have the right to keep this from me. It's my life, too!\"\n\n\"Drop it, Ana!\" \n\nFrom behind us, we hear the readying of a rifle.\n\nAna looks to me and inches her fingers toward her weapon. \"We don't want trouble.\" \n\nMy hand goes frosty with Stasis while Rasputin's fist clenches.\n\n\"You came to the wrong place,\" the rifleman says.\n\nAna cocks her head and faces him. \"Zavala?\" \n\nI turn to get a look. Before us stands the once proud Commander of the Vanguard, disheveled, in rags. His ghastly white beard is as thick as a steel door. And from the looks of him, a gentle breeze would knock him off his crutch and one remaining leg. They must have taken his Ghost too. Sad to see the deterioration of a body that's been stripped of its Light.\n\n\"Commander! You're alive!\" Ana exclaims.\n\nHe doesn't lower his rifle.\n\n\"It's me… Ana…,\" she says with hurt in her voice.\n\nHis expression never changes.\n\n\"We have a plan to take down Savathûn. We need to speak with Ikora Rey. Is she here?\" I ask.\n\nHe grimaces. \"She is,\" he says and points with his rifle toward the flotsam of the Tower. \"Buried deep under that.\""

Some things never change.\n\n\"Ikora's gone?\" Ana asks. \n\n\"Along with everything else. Whatever you have come to find, it is not here. Best you go.\"\n\n\"No, wait. We could use your help,\" Ana pleads.\n\nHe turns and hobbles away on his crutch. Ana throws her hands up in frustration. I shake my head, but she follows him with Rasputin at her side. \n\n\"Commander, this all goes back to Savathûn. If we can eliminate her for good, maybe there is hope…\"\n\nHe stops. \"There isn't.\"\n\n\"You can't just walk away. Ikora wouldn't…,\" she says.\n\nZavala turns to Ana. \"You're just like her. Always were. Stubborn and self-righteous. That's how she ended up there.\" He points to the rubble. \"Keep going, and you'll meet a similar fate. I'm sure Savathûn would happily abide.\"\n\n\"Ana, this is seeking blood from a stone. Let's go,\" I say. Surely, she sees how broken he is.\n\n\"I'm not leaving. Without Ikora, he's all we've got!\" Ana exclaims.\n\n\"He doesn't want to help us!\" \n\n\"You're a coward!\" Ana screams at him.\n\n\"A coward? I did everything I could to save the City. And her. But we were at odds. Just like the two of you. It… was our downfall,\" Zavala says. He shakes his head and sighs. \"Looks like it'll be yours, as well.\"\n\n\"Commander…\" \n\n\"I don't command anything anymore.\"\n\nThat quiets us. \n\n\"I never had the opportunity to apologize, make things right. The next time I saw her, it was too late. Don't make the same mistakes I have.\"\n\nI see how much this pains Ana. Damn it. Fine, I'll help.\n\n\"Ana doesn't recall this, but our father… what I remember of him… was a stubborn man. He and I would fight all the time, but I never walked away without telling him that I loved him. The one time I forgot, he never came back. We've made mistakes, Zavala. All of us. We won't repeat yours this time… if we fight together,\" I say. Zavala looks me up and down. \n\n\"So you're the fabled Elisabeth Bray, I take it.\" \n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"We could have used you sooner.\" \n\n\"Like when the Pyramids arrived,\" Ana chimes in.\n\n\"Our troubles began long before they showed up,\" Zavala says. \"They were just the leaves of a tree planted long ago. The Vanguard ran some cloak-and-dagger missions a while back in the Black Garden. We tried to suppress the Black Heart. It ended up corrupting the Guardians who came into contact with it. From there out, Dark Guardians spawned… and Darkness slowly spread.\" \n\n\"I'm here now. That's all that matters.\" \n\n\"Who's the other Exo?\" Zavala asks.\n\nRasputin announces himself. \n\n\"You have the Warmind? Incredible. Still… why would you need my help? He's infinitely more capable than me.\"\n\n\"Rasputin is a weapon, but we need to know where to point him,\" Ana replies.\n\n\"Which is why we could use whatever information you have to find Savathûn. We thought that if we could ally with Darkness and Light, we might stand a chance. Find symmetry where staunchness failed,\" I propose.\n\n\"That old song,\" he muses. \"Even if I could help, the Warmind won't be enough. Not for what lies beyond Savathûn. She is only a pawn.\"\n\n\"Meaning what?\"\n\n\"You want the real Witch—you want Eris Morn.\""

Our great success,\" Zavala says and gives us a half smile weighted down by years of reclusiveness. \"And our final victory.\" \n\nRasputin finds his way over to a console and plugs in. \"There are files in there I've been trying to decrypt for years. Maybe you'll have better luck,\" Zavala says. He lights a fire and prepares a kettle. \n\n\"I can't imagine Eris…,\" Ana says, her voice trailing off in shock.\n\n\"Eris wasn't special. She was corrupted as easily as the rest. She came to me after finding an artifact inside a Pyramid on the Moon and deceived us all. The Bombardment was her masterstroke, proving that the Darkness destroys all it touches.\"\n\nMy sister shoots me a knowing and somewhat hopeful glance.\n\n\"What happened that day? It's been impossible to find accurate recounts,\" Ana says.\n\n\"We were outnumbered. When the Witch Queen found me, she called me 'the nonbeliever' as she tore my leg from its joint and pulled the Light from my Ghost, discarding me like trash. Ikora had it worse.\"\n\nI look to Ana, who is hanging on every word, fighting back tears. The urge to console her rushes up from the pit in my stomach, but I repress the sensation. I wasn't meant for that. \n\n\"I looked up to the Traveler, hoping it would be our salvation from this atrocity. But instead, it just… left. Abandoned us when we needed it most. I wanted to reach out and grab it. Make it stay. Make it save us, as we always thought it would. But that was it. Gone. Cabal forces crumbled the rest.\" \n\nRasputin interrupts. \"What's that, Red?\" Ana asks.\n\n\"Did he say what I think he said?\" I ask, perking up.\n\n\"He says Ghaul's plans to ensnare the Traveler and harvest its Light, the blueprints, they're all here. He's copying them now.\" \n\nMy mind races. Zavala has been sitting on a gold mine.\n\n\"Looks like you might get your chance to capture the Traveler after all,\" I propose with vigor. \"We bring it back here. Make it fight and restore the Light.\"\n\n\"You'd need to find it first,\" Ana says. There's a hesitation in her voice. As if she actually doesn't like this plan.\n\nRasputin chimes in again in Russian. \"What's he saying?\" Zavala asks.\n\n\"He can track it. The Traveler,\" I say. \"Clovis installed the capability as a failsafe in case it ever tried to run off.\"\n\n\"Even with Red tracking it, we'd need an army to build Ghaul's device,\" Ana says pessimistically.\n\n\"Ana, this is as good a shot as we're going to get. Did you drag me all this way to give up now?\" I ask.\n\n\"No… no, you're right. We can figure this out.\"\n\nZavala smiles faintly while watching us. \n\n\"What do you say, Commander? One last ride for Ikora?\" Ana knows just what to say.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Zavala says, \"If this is the end of the world, we may as well go down swinging.\" \n\nAna's eyes light up. \"We'll still need that army.\"\n\n\"I know of someone in command of an army who has a bone to pick with Eris,\" Zavala says. \"We need to find Mara Sov.\""

Coming with me, helping me convince Zavala.\" \n\nI admit, it's been inspiring seeing Zavala renewed with purpose, even though he's chosen to keep the ratty beard.\n\n\"I couldn't have come this far without you,\" she finishes. \n\nIt has been nice being with her, despite the circumstances. It's odd having a sister again after all this time.\n\n\"Just doing my part,\" I reply.\n\nAna stares off. I can tell she wants something. So I wait.\n\n\"I need one more thing from you,\" she says.\n\nThere it is.\n\n\"I need you to show me how you use Stasis. Elsie, you're proof that it's not inherently evil. It can be controlled. You show me how, and people will see it's possible.\"\n\nI was hoping we'd moved past this.\n\n\"I'm not a figurehead for some movement, Ana. Stasis isn't something you simply control. There's constant temptation. I struggle still, to this day. Using it takes time. Discipline. And even I still haven't mastered it. Not sure I ever will,\" I say.\n\n\"We will. And when we do, all the deniers will vanish. We'll get our world back. We deserve to get it back.\"\n\n\"We deserve what we got.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself. Countless people died while you sat on the sidelines and watched everything fall apart.\"\n\n\"If you only knew, Ana. The Darkness…\"\n\n\"Always an excuse. You want to do your part? Then step up and actually help me with this.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to. What is this really about, Ana?\"\n\n\"You just don't get it.\"\n\nShe storms out, leaving a fuming wake behind. I catch a glimpse of Zavala in the corridor. He was listening.\n\n\"You're using Stasis?\" Zavala asks condescendingly.\n\n\"I get to hear it from you now, too?\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. When there was a Vanguard, I thought I had all the answers. Perhaps that was our undoing. I know now that commanding has as much to do with giving orders as it does listening to others' needs. Don't be like I was—angry and trying to control everything. Listen to your sister. Consider why she's asking this of you.\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"We're here! Approaching now!\" Ana calls out, her voice echoing down the corridor.\n\n\"Hoped I'd never see this thing again as long as I lived,\" Zavala says as we come face-to-face with the Leviathan."

Or what remains of you,\" Queen Mara Sov says with a cutting elegance as we exit our ship and board the Leviathan. \"I believed you dead.\"\n\n\"Part of me was. I am glad to have found you,\" he says.\n\n\"We are in need of all the allies we can find. And you bring the Bray sisters, I see.\"\n\nI bow. \"It's good to see you again, my Queen.\" I learned in my time with her, before everything collapsed, that the Queen is particular about her customs.\n\nMara smiles back at me. \"And you, my friend.\"\n\n\"Where is Calus?\" Zavala asks.\n\n\"We are unsure of his whereabouts. A problem for another day.\"\n\nShe's surrounded by Cabal and Fallen working alongside what's left of the Awoken army. I had heard some defected to Eris after Mara's failed assaults. Everyone has lost so much to the Dark armies. \n\n\"I'm surprised you don't have Vex here as well,\" Ana says discourteously.\n\n\"An attempt at humor, my Queen,\" I say, nudging Ana in the hopes of conveying to her that the Queen expects respect. \n\n\"The Vex are trapped in time by our betrayer and her Dark army,\" Mara says.\n\n\"We have something that we believe can turn the tide,\" Zavala says, gesturing toward Rasputin. \"The Warmind can locate the Traveler using Clovis Bray's tracking algorithm. We know how to capture the Traveler once we find it, but we'll need your army to build the harness.\" \n\n\"I have slowly been gathering forces in preparation of striking back at Eris and the Witch Queen. I would invite you to join our ranks and swear allegiance, but I can smell the aroma of Darkness around you,\" Mara says, her gaze resting on me.\n\n\"My Queen,\" I say, lowering my head, \"I am wielding Stasis, but we want the same end: to survive this.\" \n\nShe's unconvinced. \n\n\"Elisabeth, you once asked me to pick a side, even if it was the wrong one. Tell me, did you choose correctly?\" she asks.\n\n\"I should hope so, since I am at your side once more.\"\n\nMara and Zavala exchange a loaded glance and he nods, offering his approval.\n\n\"Do not mistake my hospitality for trust. You will earn it on the battlefield.\"\n\nI bow again. Ana does not.\n\n\nLater, as I approach the Queen's quarters, I overhear Zavala. \"…have to be aware, I do not fully trust her. I think she has a thirst for Darkness.\" \n\n\"We will do our best to keep a close eye on that one,\" Mara responds.\n\nHow could they still not trust me?\n\n\"If things go south, I'll do it myself. Ana is my friend, after all,\" he replies.\n\nOh. \n\n\"What are they saying?\" Ana whispers, startling me.\n\n\"Nothing. Let's go,\" I say quietly.\n\n\"Is there a spy in our midst?\" Mara calls out. Not quiet enough, I guess.\n\n\"No, ma'am. We were just coming in to talk strategy,\" Ana says as we enter the room. Quick thinking! \"The Leviathan presents some interesting possibilities.\"\n\n\"My forces are constructing the harness as we speak. No matter what advantages you believe we have, we are still underprepared for the threat we face. Eris Morn is powerful in ways even I do not comprehend. She is using the Darkness to its full potential.\"\n\n\"What if we're able to do the same… but with the Light?\" I propose.\n\n\n\nThrough the unending expanse of space, we see a soft light, a beacon. The Traveler.\n\n\"There you are,\" Zavala says to himself as Mara and her makeshift army ready themselves.\n\nAs we approach, I am awestruck. I forgot how massive it is. We have one shot at this.\n\n\"Red says he's able to access some of the ship's higher functions and weaponry. Dormant satellite arrays as well. Could prove useful,\" Ana says.\n\n\"Some good news, finally,\" Zavala exhales. \"Elisabeth…\"\n\nSuddenly, Zavala collapses to the floor, grabbing his head and screaming loud enough to echo through the Leviathan.\n\n\"What happened?\" Mara demands.\n\n\"I don't know! He just fell,\" Ana responds.\n\nHis eyes open wide. He calms. Then he speaks.\n\n\"We need you. Return to us.\"  \n\nIs he? He's speaking… to the Traveler?\n\n\"You chose us before. Please, give us another chance.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes and rubs his head.\n\n\"It intends to run,\" Zavala says, standing and regaining his composure.\n\n\"What are we gonna do?\" Ana asks.\n\nZavala releases a deep, focused breath. \"Take it back. By force.\"\n\n\"Launch the harness!\" Mara Sov commands as her crew gets to work.\n\nIt fires as the Traveler becomes aware, burning with a rich, luminous glow. Too bright to keep staring. I shield my eyes hoping we built this right. \n\nThe Leviathan shakes, and I grab onto the wall to keep from falling. \n\nThe light fades, and my eyes adjust. Sure enough, the harness has latched onto the sphere like a barnacle, the six arms gripped tight. The Leviathan erupts in applause. I look for Ana, but I can't find her in the mass of bodies.\n\n\"We're coming home, Ikora,\" Zavala says pridefully."

Something isn't right.\"\n\n\"Weren't you just advocating that I listen to her?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see if something was off with you as well.\"\n\n\"You're a bastard,\" I seethe. \n\n\"I'm making sure we're successful.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for her. You'd be rotting away on that wreckage.\"\n\n\"Are you done?\"\n\n\"She's my sister. My responsibility. You don't get to make that call.\"\n\nI know whose shoulders bear this burden, and in this moment, he does too.\n\n\"Then if it comes to it, let's hope you have the strength to see it through. For all our sakes,\" he says.\n\n\nThe Leviathan is quiet. Not the atmosphere of a rallied army charging headfirst on to victory. This feels like a death march. It's not my place to rouse the crowd, so I stand next to Ana and watch as we approach the Moon, the Traveler locked in tow within the harness.\n\n\"Everyone knows their part. I would like to say that I will see you all again on the other side, but we know that isn't true. That's not why we are here. We are here to stop Eris Morn, at all costs,\" Zavala says. \n\nHe and Mara exchange a glance and a nod. He walks past us without another word, past the Cabal and Fallen. Guess he doesn't like goodbyes, either.\n\n\"We have arrived. Ready yourselves,\" the Queen orders. \"Make no mistake: Eris will die this day.\"\n \nWe rush into the drop ships, leaving Rasputin to pilot the Leviathan. I join Ana and Mara on our journey to the surface. \n\n\"Ana… for all those years, I did what I had to do. But I am sorry it was at the expense of us,\" I say. \n\n\"Save it for after. We're gonna win.\"\n\nThe drop ship hits the ground with a thud, sending tremors through me. The door opens, and we're greeted with a frontal assault of Thrall. We come out firing. It's chaotic, but through the turmoil, I spot the Scarlett Keep. I see Eris Morn, drawing power from beneath the surface, and I see an army of Dark Guardians stampeding toward us.\n\nI look up to the Leviathan and the Traveler, aglow in a phosphorescent haze. He's doing it. Zavala is overcharging himself with Light, siphoning from the Traveler using Ghaul's plans and tech. Good luck, Commander, and thank you.\n\nAna and Mara fight through the Hive mercilessly as the Dark Guardians approach. I find Ana and signal toward Eris. In lockstep, we carry out our assault. Ana opens fire on a Hunter while I cover her, blasting a flanking Ogre with Stasis. Ana drops a grenade under its massive feet, and a second later, it's dust. Eris spots us, and I swear she's smiling. From behind the Keep, a full brigade of the Awoken armada rises, perverted with Hive thorns and insignia. \n\nNow's the time, Warmind. \n\nAs the Awoken defectors fire onto the battlefield, they're blasted out of the sky by satellite arrays in a dazzling display. I can feel Eris's frustration at this. Then I see her, shrouded in Darkness, performing a summoning ritual. \n\nA singular beam of blinding Light tears through the black sky with the velocity of a shooting star, headed straight for the Scarlett Keep. \n\nGive 'em hell, Commander. \n\nHe collides with the structure so precisely that he only creates a small fissure. After a moment, an explosion, bright and disastrous, completely levels the Keep to rubble. We hear a deafening scream throughout the field that could only be Savathûn. Mara races to us. \"The Witch is weakened. We strike now!\" \n\nEris is regaining her footing as we close in. \"All of my detractors in one place. Thank you for bringing them to me, Ana,\" she says and smiles. \n\nI turn to Ana, confused. She pulls out a knife and readies it toward Mara. I make a move to stop her, but I can't. I'm frozen in place… by Ana. She stabs Mara Sov in front of us. \"You're welcome, my Queen.\" Stasis and blood drip from her hands. \n\n\"We are all Dark, eventually,\" Eris says with glee."

The Darkness cannot thrive while believers of the Light remain. There's a world beyond this conflict.

Don't you want to be a family again?\"\n\nNot like this. Not through death and betrayal. Zavala was right about her… I remember the promise I made. \n\n\"I forgive you for all the years you kept me in the dark. I know you were trying to protect me. Forget the past. We can start over. Let me protect you now,\" she says with such sincerity that I know she's too far gone to reason with.\n\nThe look on Ana's face tells me she knows where I've landed. She's genuinely hurt, gritting her teeth to stop herself from crying. I try to raise my hand to blast her, but she's already on the move.\n\nAna attacks and stabs me in my side, disconnecting core components. My left arm goes limp. I look up to see Eris summoning a portal. The Vex come flooding through. Our army of Cabal and Fallen are being eviscerated. Vex Hydras swarm the Leviathan and open fire. If I could cry, I would. We lost. Again.\n\nSuddenly, Eris stands above me with a twisted grin. \"Do you see what the path of the self-righteous yields? You call it protection, but all Ana felt was abandonment. You left a void. Darkness filled it.\"\n\n\"You have bigger problems,\" I say, looking to the sky.\n\nA piercing noise emanates from the Traveler. Its brilliance begins to swell. Worried and confused, Eris commands all her forces to focus on killing it with Dark energy.\n\n\"It didn't have to be this way,\" Ana cries as she drives the knife into me once more. \"You could have been with me!\"\n\nI finally shatter my own binding, blasting her with Stasis. She flies back, locked in the air. I see her struggling. \"Ana, she's corrupted you!\" \n\n\"No… She gave me purpose!\" \n\nDamn it all. I know what I have to do. \n\nI kiss her forehead as I turn her blade and thrust it into her. Her eyes go wide, and some semblance of my sister returns before she fades. \n\n\"Elsie…\" she trails off into the void. My own sister… Eris will pay for this. \n\nThe Darkness energy Eris manipulates canvases the landscape and makes its way to the sky. I see the Traveler, getting brighter as the Darkness encapsulates it. I race toward Eris, but I'm too late. \n\nIn an enchanting explosion, the Traveler's Light enshrouds all in totality. \n\nThen darkness. n\nI'm awake. \n\nI see a tower. THE Tower.\n\nI'm in the Last City. It's… thriving. Bustling with life. Children laughing.\n\nThere's a small parade. I fight through the crowd to find Cayde-6 at the center of it. \"I think I finally got him this time!\" he shouts as a beardless Zavala greets him. \n\n\"Taniks has been dead before,\" Zavala says. \n\nFrom behind him emerges Ikora Rey, like a vision. \"Let the new Hunter Vanguard bask. He's earned it.\"\n\nI'm so sick of this scene. Of hearing these words ever since the day I killed my sister. That was the first time. Now I've lost count. \n\nNo matter what I do, it always ends the same. Blood and betrayal. Then I'm back where I started. Right here.\n\nI'm being taunted, punished. Forced to relive this loop.\n\nThere has to be a way out. I will find it. \n\nI have to save my sister."

Caiatl's father often said, \"Ahztja is an athenaeum world in and of herself.\" He often retreated, either into his pleasures or his unpredictable melancholy, leaving Ahztja to fill Caiatl's mind with fantasy. \n\nHolding a toy model of a warship in her hands, Caiatl sat on the floor before Ahztja. \"Ahztja,\" she said politely, knowing she would not receive her story otherwise, \"Please tell me how the faraway peoples say the universe came to be.\"\n\nAhztja considered, searching through the library of her mind, and then nodded.\n\n\"Imagine the universe as swirling chaos,\" Ahztja said softly.\n\nCaiatl closed her eyes and saw it.\n\n\"Among the chaos stands Irkyn La, the First Host, who blinks herself into existence with the First Thought: chaos must come to order.\"\n\nCaiatl saw a creature, tremendous beyond belief, in her mind's eye.\n\n\"And so to satisfy the First Thought, which would become the First Law, Irkyn La consumes the chaos of the void and gives birth to the ordered universe.\"\n\nCaiatl opened her eyes, and they were bright with intrigue. \n\n\"That is how the Tiiarn would say the universe began,\" Ahztja said. \n\nCaiatl looked at the toy in her hands, and then back at Ahztja. \"Where does this giant woman live?\" \n\n\"The Tiiarn would say she is the very fabric of the universe. When you look to the sky, when you look out into space, you are looking into Irkyn La's mouth.\" \n\nCaiatl turned her toy for a little while. Then, looking up, she said fiercely, \"I will challenge Irkyn La to a battle and defeat her. Then my people will own everything in the universe.\" \n\nAhztja chuckled fondly. \"Yes, I think you would,\" she said. \"But the empire has already defeated the Tiiarn. None of them are left. And with no one to believe in her, Irkyn La is dead as well.\" \n\n\"Then I will believe in her.\" \n\nAhztja's lips pulled back in a curious smile. \"You'll believe in her so that you can challenge her?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\nLaughing again, Ahztja placed her hand on Caiatl's head. \"Ah, brave Caiatl. A warrior so mighty, she wills her enemies into existence.\" \n\nCaiatl's chest swelled with incandescent pride."

It twisted and turned on itself to create strange, rotting landforms all around her. She passed mountains that sprouted weeping tumors and saw fields crusted over with scabrous tissue. \n\nThe exhilaration of flight made her eyes sharp; the familiarity of the controls kept her hands steady. She was so much better here than in any of her father's tedious lessons. Awake. Alive. \n\nUmun'arath's voice rumbled in her ear like a surfacing landwhale. \n\n\"Imagine all of Torobatl as the putrid grave swamps of Aark,\" she said. \"Centuries sunk in muck. A testament to someone else's conquest.\" \n\nCaiatl narrowed her eyes at her ship's heads-up display as a corrupted flame suddenly burned a hole in the sky itself, straight ahead…\n\n\"There are monsters at the edges of our territory that would tear our world open and turn it inside out,\" Umun growled. \"They fear nothing.\" \n\nCaiatl felt a jolt: the telltale rock, tilt, and drag of damage at the tail of the ship. She tried to pull up. Through the hole in the sky emerged a hag: enormous, robed, screaming. Emerald fire burst from her claws and spiraled toward Caiatl's ship, but she was too dazzled by the fireworks to avoid it. \n\nSeconds before the flames engulfed her ship, Caiatl heard: \"What do you fear, Princess?\" \n\nIn these war chambers, simulated death felt like real death. Panic, pain, darkness. Realistic consequences for failure. The chamber left its inhabitants floating in a void after defeat—and in that emptiness, minutes could feel like hours. \n\nWhen the darkness finally evaporated, Caiatl stood in the blank chamber. Alone. \n\nUmun emerged and crossed the room. \"You're dead,\" she told her. \n\nCaiatl kept her back straight and voice level, though there was a tremor in her arm—a humiliating aftereffect. \"Yes.\" \n\n\"You were distracted,\" Umun said. \"I saw you: looking around, like you were on a sightseeing flight.\" She made a dismissive gesture with her left hand. \"Weaned and coddled on too many stories.\"\n\n\"I won't fail again,\" Caiatl said. \n\n\"Wrong,\" said Umun'arath. \"You will die many more times if you wish to live.\" She clapped a hand on Caiatl's shoulder. \"Do it again.\""

They wore a strange, sleek armored suit—some off-world species unaccustomed to the atmosphere, no doubt. But her father's influence on it was obvious; he did so favor white, purple, and gold. \n\n\"He can keep them,\" Caiatl said. The assassin's gun, pointed at her chest, glowed with a purple light that distorted the air around it. \n\n\"He sent a message for you.\" \n\nCaiatl lunged, crashing her shoulder into the assassin. They fired their weapon, and Void energy seared through Caiatl's bicep. Undeterred, she slammed the assassin to the ground, clutching their throat in one hand and making a fist with the other. She cocked her arm back. Her reflection in the assassin's helmet stared back at her. Furious. Unblinking. Curious. \n\n\"Go on then,\" she snarled, her fist looming. \"The message.\" \n\nThe assassin struggled. \"You are a child in a general's costume,\" they spat. \"None of the vision of your father. None of the drive or strength of the one they call Dominus.\" Something sharp penetrated Caiatl's pressure suit and slipped up against her ribs. \"You will not be remembered.\" \n\nSpurred to action, Caiatl rolled to unseat the blade; the assassin followed and raised the Void weapon to her head. \n\nCaiatl slammed her hand over the barrel. Energy shot through her palm as she ripped the gun away. She grabbed the assassin's helmet with her bloody fingers and slammed their head against the ground. Once, twice, three times. \n\nThe shield began to crack. \n\nFour, five, six times. \n\nShe let the helmet thud against the ground. Her contorted reflection now stared back. \n\n\"Is he listening?\" Caiatl boomed. \"My father? Tell him I will come for him. Tell him there's no distance that will save him from me.\" \n\nThe assassin gasped and wheezed. When they recovered their voice, they hissed, \"Killing me will not stop the end… from coming. My gods have foretold…\" \n\nCaiatl hesitated for a brief moment before her good hand clenched into a fist and slammed into the assassin's visor, shattering her reflection as well as the assassin's skull. \n\nShe sat back in the wreckage, panting, covered in strange, viscous blood. \n\n\"Your gods are dead,\" she said to no one."

My lovers choke on toxic fumes simply walking through the halls.\" \n\nSurprised she hadn't heard about it before, Caiatl dismissed him with a promise to investigate the Evocate-General's chambers. \n\nLater that day, she found that the first of Umun's rooms, usually kept tidy with military precision, was changed. Her two war tables were covered in papers and tomes unrecognizable to Caiatl. The room stank of death and poison. Strange symbols were drawn on the ground in ash. \n\nIn the far corner of the room, with the restraints they used for captives aboard their prison ships, a living Hive Thrall was held in suspension, drooling and chattering. \n\n\"Umun,\" Caiatl said, astonished. \"What's happening here?\" \n\nUmun turned from one of her war tables where she studied a book that looked to be bound with mottled flesh. \"Princess,\" she said, pleased. \"Good. I thought to call you, but I've been so engrossed. Come see the future of the Cabal army.\" \n\nCaiatl approached, intent on looking at Umun instead of the Thrall. \n\n\"They don't fear pain,\" Umun said. Perverse admiration crept into her voice. \"They don't fear death.\" \n\n\"Soldiers who don't know pain or fear are useless,\" Caiatl said, eyeing the Evocate-General. \"'It is the knowledge of death and the will to defy it that together breed bravery.' You taught me those texts.\" \n\n\"We must move beyond them,\" Umun muttered, watching the Thrall tilt its grotesque face in response to their voices. \"With each swing of the sword, the universe grows smaller, Caiatl. The competition fiercer. If we don't learn a new way, we'll be cut down with the rest.\" Her voice went quiet. \"We must accept new gods, or we'll perish.\" \n\nThe Thrall began to thrash, sudden and violent. \n\nCaiatl watched. \n\n\"I am ordering you to step down from the council,\" she said after a long silence."

Umun'arath stood against the blaze, naked but for a waist wrap, in the custody of two guards. Her hide was carved with strange, crude symbols. When she saw Caiatl arrive, she threw her head back and laughed. \n\n\"Here comes the Princess-Imperial,\" she said. \"To kneel before our new god.\"[I am Savathûn, whispering.]\n\nCaiatl strode forward. \"Let her go,\" she told the guards. Reluctant, they did as she asked. \"What god, Umun? What heresies have you invented now?\" \n\nUmun grinned. \"The god of war,\" she said, and the earth trembled beneath them. \n\n[But the god of war has planted her armies elsewhere; it is her sister, smiling, that has taken the ear of the warchild Umun'arath.] \n\nCaiatl stood before Umun in the flickering green light of the fire. \"Your obsession is a weakness,\" she said. \"And a threat to our prosperity.\" \n\n\"You can't stop it now,\" Umun lilted, breathless with delight. \n\n[Xivu Arath, hear me.] \n\nCaiatl didn't break her stare. \"I have no choice but to—\"\n\nUmun, chuckling, raised her hands. They glowed. The fire behind her burned higher and chattered like rattling bones. \"The war is all there is,\" she said. \n\nAs the chattering reached a fevered pitch, Caiatl made a decision. With the lightning-quick reflexes Umun had taught her, she unsheathed the ceremonial sword at her side and ran it through Umun's middle. \n\nUmun laughed. \n\n[You are war, and I conjure you with war and blood.] \n\nShe laughed and laughed and laughed until her mouth began to ooze. Until Caiatl, disgusted, pushed her off the sword with her foot.

She watched them for a tense moment and then raised her voice to say, \"Enough.\" \n\nAll looked to the Princess-Imperial. \n\n\"My father was infatuated with the myth of his own benevolence,\" Caiatl said. \"He gorged himself and his people on stories of what the empire could be and took half-measures to make it so. But he never succeeded. He never wished to succeed. I am not my father. \n\n\"Dominus Ghaul was obsessed with his own redemption. He imagined debts owed to him and sought their fulfilment. He used the Legion as a tool to secure himself and his legacy. He saw the empire as one more thing he was owed. I am not Dominus Ghaul. \n\n\"Umun'arath misled me—misled us all. Our people are not meant to flee our battles. But neither are we the Hive, throwing ourselves on the blade again and again. There is strength in tactical retreat.\" \n\nShe studied the worried faces of her councilors and felt shame for their weakness, but responsibility as well. \"We'll direct all our surviving ships to the Sol system to reclaim whatever remains of the Legion. This is my first order, as empress of the Cabal.\" \n\nThe next day, as they fled their homeworld, a coronation was held upon the Eligos Lex V, royal flagship of Empress Caiatl, leader of the Cabal."

Some of you lament our loss. Some of you whisper about the weakness of retreat. I assure you, we do not flee out of weakness. We march toward strength. \n\nWe have found ourselves in a battle with war itself. And I have come to see that the face of war is ugly and poisonous. \n\nWe are not the same as our enemies. We fight for a reason. For a purpose. \n\nNot for pointless luxury, nor the approval of false gods. Unlike our predecessors, we fight to pay homage to our past and make strides towards our future. A future where all glory is not for vanity but for our people. We fight for the empire. \n\nWe now chart toward the Sol system, to recover the soldiers stranded there by Ghaul's hubris. We will rebuild our army and return to reclaim our home. \n\nOur future will not look the same as our past. With your trust, I will usher us into a new age, and I will not default on my promises, as my father did before me. \n\nFrom this moment forward, all Psions of the Cabal Empire are released from the bonds of servitude and granted full citizenship. You are free to remain or leave as you please. You will be granted reasonable supplies for your departure, if you choose to go. \n\nIf you stay, I must warn you: the battle ahead will be long and arduous. Many of us will fight, bleed, and die to preserve our collective freedoms. But together, we will build an army where warriors fight not for themselves, or for their grasping leaders, but for each other. \n\nThere will be no mercy for false gods. The Cabal Empire will rise from this challenge victorious. United. We will draw from our past to give strength to our future. \n\nAs one Cabal. \n\n//END MESSAGE//"

She was a stickler for formality. \"The other councilors are awaiting a decision regarding our arrival in Sol.\" \n\nCaiatl gave her a wry look. As if she didn't know. \n\nTaurun waited. When Caiatl didn't answer, she pressed further. \"Have you made a decision?\" \n\nCaiatl sighed and shifted in her seat. \"Not yet,\" she said. \"There is much still to consider. Sit down.\" \n\nTaurun hesitated, caught between her dedication to formality and a direct order from her empress. She gingerly lowered herself into a chair. \n\n\"The Guardians killed Ghaul,\" Caiatl said. \n\n\"Yes,\" said Taurun. \n\n\"Stories say they've killed greater enemies too.\" \n\n\"Other deities of the Hive. One of the great worms.\" \n\n\"And a sibling of Xivu Arath,\" Caiatl added. \n\n\"Perhaps then, the costs of this venture do not outweigh the benefits,\" Taurun mused. \n\n\"We need every resource at our disposal,\" Caiatl said. \n\nTaurun was quiet. \n\nCaiatl leaned forward abruptly in her seat. \"Do we need to make war to regain the Legion?\" \n\nOnce more, Taurun was silent. Eventually, she said carefully, \"You don't believe we would win?\" \n\nCaiatl saw the blade hidden in Taurun's question. \"We would win,\" she said. \"After a long, grueling war. We'd sustain huge losses. And we'd leave ourselves open to further devastation at the war god's hands.\" \n\nTaurun's gaze turned thoughtful. \"Yes, probably.\" She studied Caiatl's face. \"So what do you suggest?\" \n\n\"We… negotiate,\" Caiatl said quietly. \"With the Guardians.\" \n\nTaurun observed her customary moment of silence. \"Some of the councilors won't like it.\" \n\n\"I know,\" Caiatl said. She stared past Taurun, her jaw set. \"I don't either.\" \n\n\"You'll have to make a gesture for them. A nod to our legacy as conquerors. If they see it as a true, equal negotiation…\" Taurun trailed off. \n\n\"They'll call it weakness,\" Caiatl finished. \n\nTaurun nodded. \"Especially after fleeing Torobatl.\" \n\nThey shared another silence. The ache of mounting stress began to push at Caiatl's temples. \n\nHer voice was weary when she spoke again. \"Then we will demand that the Guardians kneel.\""

        "text": "Val Ma'rag  had been \"stationed' in the place the Humans called a dead zone  for years now, though he had no commander, no handler . He held the territory on his own, defending it from the stinking, vermin Hive. They reminded him of the tiny red beetles that crawled around in the dust where he'd come up; the ones that swarmed war beast pens and crept into woven clothes. The best way to get rid of them, his mother taught him, was to hold a flame close to the seams of their shells. They snapped and popped in the heat.\n\nHe found the same to be true for the Hive. \n\nBy now, he'd stopped expecting anyone to come for him. Their invasion had become a death sentence; one he had accepted by the nature of his position. He would die for the Legion, with or without the promise of reward. \n\nAs Val Ma'rag listened to a transmission from the Empress Caiatl, he thought about how far he'd come since he was recruited. Since he was pulled out of the poorest rural district on his planet. With this new challenge—with the new empress sending her call out into the system—he could go a lot farther. \n\n///\n\nEuropa was cold. Basilius  was no stranger to cold—he'd been stationed on Mars before it disappeared, before his Valus  sent him and his reports off-planet on a recon mission. He didn't care for intel  or resource gathering, but a Valus is law. Or at least, he was. \n\nAfter a false start  on Nessus, they'd brought the cruiser to Europa. The icy moon was crawling with thieving Fallen, but there were secrets buried in the ice. Dainty Human technology. It didn't interest him, but the Psions loved to tinker, and they insisted there was something here worthwhile. \n\nSomething that could catch the attention of an empress hoping to regain favor with her scattered people. Something that might win a soldier like him, with no valuable titles or reputation to his name, a new level of recognition. \n\nAnd the respect he deserved. \n\n///\n\nAs the voice of their so-called empress droned on from a beat-up radio, the soldiers ate. Commander Dracus picked at the bones of a roasted bird, gun laid across his lap. The little red-violet winged creatures on Nessus didn't have much meat on them, but they were challenging and satisfying to trap. \n\n\"What's she mean, 'ancient rites'?\" a young Legionary asked. \n\nThe commander looked up. \n\n\"Old-timer traditions?\" she went on. \n\nDracus snorted. \"An honored tradition,\" he said. \"Beloved by the Praetorate . Warriors take on challengers to prove their battle-worth.\" He eyed her. \"Calves like you wouldn't remember that.\" \n\n\"Is it open to anyone?\" the Legionary asked. \n\nHe laughed. \n\n\"Well,\" she growled. \"Are you taking challengers?\" She squared her weight. \"You can start with me.\" \n\nDracus looked the bold youngling up and down, calculating the effort. He had no great desire to impress the disgraced emperor's pampered daughter. The leader he knew and served was the dominus , dead or alive. But maybe there was money to be gained from this. He wouldn't turn his nose up at the prospect. \n\nHe tossed the bird bones aside, lifted his gun, and fired a shot right into the Legionary's belly. She fell. \n\n\"I win,\" he said. \n\n///\n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she'd risen far above her station in a fraction of her lifetime. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she pulled things from her mind that should be out of reach from memory. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she grasped for everything she could not have. \n\nIt was all true. On the strange terrain of the Nessus centaur, Ixel had extracted herself from command. The Valus had been uncreative, small minded. He hadn't seen the value in the Vex technologies that might amplify Ixel's unique Psionic talents. So she killed him and poached the unit's best fighters. \n\nHard to say if this competition was open to traitors of the empire. \n\nAnd yet somehow, this new empress, foolish though she was, might be inspired by bold action. \n\nNot to mention the things Ixel could pull from the prediction engines. Intelligence beyond the empress's imagining. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because her ambition was limitless."

She'd watched her beloved city burn. \n\nCaiatl learned from every failure. From this one, she learned two things: First, that warriors were not game pieces, no matter how much her generals enjoyed bickering over war tables. And second, that a society of warriors could not hope to beat a god of war at her own game, and by her own rules. \n\nThere were shades of victory. Escaping their homeworld with so many survivors was a victory. Regaining their army was a victory. Avoiding an all-out war with the Guardians would be another. \n\nExcept the Guardians would not negotiate. \n\nShe hadn't expected it. She'd thought that after Ghaul's attack, they would do anything to avoid another war. Catastrophe seemed to befall this system time and time again, if the Red Legion scribes  stranded here were to be believed. So why did the Guardians refuse a way out? \n\nShe knew why, of course. It was why she'd waited so long before giving the evacuation order in Torobatl. Why she'd been mesmerized by the towering form of Xivu Arath crushing thousands of years of civilization beneath her chitin boots. \n\nDenial. Pride. \n\nBut Caiatl had grown since then. She'd counted her losses. Calculated constantly. Always working the numbers, never losing sight of who they represented. \n\nThe Guardians would have to grow as well, if they wished to survive. For there were gods walking through this world, and the battle against them would not be won through denial and pride. \n\nThey would have to cut a new path."

Something… mysterious.\" Glint hovered eagerly over Crow's shoulder, his shell flaps tilted encouragingly. \"We should go see Tess .\" \n\n\"First of all,\" Crow muttered, \"we're not undercover. This mission is reconnaissance, not infiltration.\" \n\n\"Of course,\" Glint chirped, \"but—\"\n\n\"Second of all,\" Crow continued, \"I'm the one who needs a disguise, not you. Nobody knows who you are.\" \n\n\"That's not true,\" Glint protested. \"I've been around for hundreds of years! I've met everybody.\" \n\n\"As 'Pork Bun'  or whatever it was,\" Crow gently teased. \"Nobody in the Tower knows you have a new Guardian.\" \n\nGlint whirred in a low tone, which Crow had learned to interpret as grumbling. \n\nThe Awoken Lightbearer ignored his Ghost's petulance and checked the position of the sun. He moved a few feet further into shadow before refocusing his attention on Commander Zavala. The last thing Crow wanted was for the Titan to spot the binoculars' reflection. \n\nIt had been like this for the past week. During the days, Crow would cover Zavala from afar with his Sniper Rifle, vigilant for any unusual transmat signatures  or the faint shimmer of cloaking tech . At night, when visibility was restricted, the pair would creep into the Tower and act as the commander's invisible bodyguards. \n\nCrow burrowed further into his new Hunter cloak. It really was a beautiful garment, he thought. He admired the fine fabric, chosen by Glint and gifted to him by Osiris. Recalling their generosity made him feel suddenly guilty about his stinginess. \n\nCrow sighed. \"Fine. After this mission, once we know Zavala is safe, we can get you a disguise.\" \n\nGlint scooted in front of Crow's face, his mechanical iris  suddenly magnified through the binoculars. \"Can we really?\" \n\n\"I suppose,\" Crow murmured as he tilted his head to see past the bobbing Ghost. \"But not because you need it.\" \n\n\"Because we're friends,\" Glint stated matter-of-factly. \n\n\"Sure. Rare  friends. Maybe even cheap, legendary  friends.\" Crow smiled at his Ghost. \"But not exotic  friends. You'll have to find a new Guardian for that.\" \n\n\"You're the best,\" Glint hummed encouragingly. \"No matter what Lord Saladin says.\" \n\nCrow snorted at the mention of the Iron Lord. \"We're all on the same side. Sooner or later, Saladin will realize it, and start treating me like a real Guardian.\" \n\n\"Don't worry,\" Glint chirped, \"with the legendary Pork Bun by your side, how could he refuse?\""

He was looking out at the City the same way he always did, even before he was commander: with a blend of fierce determination, love, and dread. A combination Ikora knew very well herself. \n\nShe stood next to him, resting her hands on the railing, looking up at the Traveler and the stars. \n\n\"They say that before the Collapse, cities were so bright that they outshined the stars,\" she said quietly. \n\nIt was no surprise to her when he said nothing. Living for hundreds of years didn't endow you with deep understanding of another person, it turned out. Close and steady partnership did. She knew him by now. He held his fears close to his chest, protecting the people he cared about. But with time, with patience, he would let her see. Sometimes. So she waited. \n\n\"I keep seeing his face,\" Zavala murmured after a long silence. \n\nIkora looked at him, her expression falling. When she spoke, her voice was soft with grief. \"Cayde?\" \n\n\"No,\" Zavala said. He gripped the railing with both hands, a gesture of frustration and self-doubt. \"Uldren Sov.\" \n\nIkora straightened, surprised. That sharp feeling of being caught off guard , of realizing you'd missed something, froze her for a moment. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked cautiously. \n\n\"In the Tower,\" Zavala said. \"In crowds…\" He hesitated. \"I saw him… in the gardens. He called out to me. To warn me about the assassin.\" \n\nSilence again. \n\nZavala exhaled slowly. \"Do you ever listen to the old Golden Age stories Eva tells during the festival? About apparitions of the dead?\" \n\n\"'Ghosts,'\" Ikora said quickly. \"That's what they called them. But those are fairytales.\" Who needed ghost stories when the dead could already get up and walk? \n\nShe watched Zavala sidelong . Waiting for him to say it. Waiting for him to ask. \n\n\"I don't know why my mind goes to folk stories. I suppose because the alternative is…\"\n\n\"Too hard,\" Ikora interrupted softly. \"Too hard to imagine.\" \n\nZavala closed his eyes and nodded. \n\nNeither of them said anything for a few minutes. Eventually, Zavala broke the silence. \"But if he were back, we would know,\" he said. \n\nIkora stared straight ahead. She felt him watching her, checking her. He was so tired. So, so tired. \n\nHe would trust whatever she said. \n\nShe reached to put a hand on his shoulder and said, gently, as her gut twisted with guilt, \"We would know.\" \n\nZavala placed his hand over hers. \n\nThey stood together, looking out at the Last Safe City of Earth, with a profound distance between them that Ikora had never felt before."

Nearby, Osiris watched the Psion prisoner, restrained by a set of centuries-old iron shackles. \n\nSaladin continued, \"You were conquered by the Cabal. And in the face of a superior military force, you did what you had to do to survive. There's no shame in that.\" \n\nThe Psion flared their moist facial flaps and fixed their lone eye on the Iron Lord . Saladin wondered whether they were glaring in defiance, or struggling to breathe without their helmet. He marveled at their repulsiveness. \n\n\"But even after Calus fled, and Ghaul was defeated, you still grovel before tyrants like Caiatl. If you rose up, you could taste true independence instead of the patronizing scraps that she offers .\" Saladin shook his head in contempt. \"Your power is wasted by cowardice.\" \n\nIn the silence that followed, the Iron Lord noticed a curious change in the surrounding atmosphere. The air filled with a sharp frequency—not a sound, but a high-intensity vibration that seemed to emanate from inside his own head, like a blossoming migraine . \n\nOsiris chuckled. \"Our friend disagrees.\" \n\nSaladin snarled and grabbed the Psion by their shackled wrists. He dragged his prisoner to the edge of the wall and held them over the precipice. He was amazed at how light they were without armor, like a scrawny little bird. \n\nOsiris sniffed in distaste and looked back toward the Last City. He doubted Saladin's ham-fisted  style of interrogation would work, but the Psion had resisted his own subtler approach. \n\n\"Where did they get the Light-dampening tech ? How did they modify the prediction engines ?\" Saladin snapped. The Iron Lord held firm as the Psion struggled weakly in his grip. \"Where are they? Where's the rest of the cell ?\" \n\nThe Psion's lone eye  fluttered wildly, and Saladin felt a sudden rush of vertigo, as if he was the one with the hundred-meter drop beneath him. The Titan steeled  himself. \n\n\"We will find them eventually. You can't control that. The only thing you can control now is your own survival. Tell us where they are.\" \n\nThe Psion began to tremble, like an animal shivering in the cold. But they said nothing. Instead, they assaulted the Iron Lord with another wave of vertigo. \n\nThe wall felt as if it were flexing and tilting beneath the Titan. He growled through clenched teeth. \"Last chance: where are they?\" \n\nSuddenly, Osiris was at Saladin's side. The vertigo broke. \"Lord Saladin,\" he urged. \"This is a waste of time. You of all people should recognize unrelenting stubbornness when you see it.\" \n\n\"You're right.\" Saladin regarded the Psion with quiet admiration. \"If the roles were reversed, I'd rather die than betray my loyalty.\" \n\nThe Iron Lord gave the Psion a nod of respect, and then effortlessly hefted them over the edge. \n\nIn the split second before gravity took hold, Lord Saladin met the Psion's gaze. He suddenly saw himself reflected in the creature's Y-shaped pupil: a ferocious ogre in metal armor, filled with violence. A dull primate, infused with godlike power. A fragile mind cursed with immortality. \n\nSaladin felt the creature's terror. But he also felt the expanse of the Psion's ancestors yawn forth  beneath him. He felt their hands reach up to embrace him in a comforting void. He heard the ringing chorus of their timeless harmony call to him. A kaleidoscopic  array of emotion surged through his heart, such that he'd never known as a Human. \n\nFor that fleeting moment, he was at peace. \n. \n. \n. \nThen the Psion was gone, and Saladin was alone with Osiris once more."

The empress thought it looked preposterous on the bridge of her warship. \n\nShe would have jettisoned the gaudy antique out an airlock if not for Taurun. Her prudent counselor advised that the throne not only conferred authority, but was also now a relic of an endangered species. Any memento of their culture, no matter how trivial, was invaluable. \n\nHaving lost the Red Legion, their dominus , and their homeworld, Caiatl's people needed tradition to galvanize them. They needed the touchstones  of their past to carry them into the terrifying future. They needed to feel like they were still Cabal. \n\nCaiatl considered the throne in context of the decision before her. The leader of the Vanguard had offered to settle their dispute with a Rite of Proving . It would preempt an exhausting war of attrition with a single, decisive engagement. An exceedingly clever tactic she had not considered. \n\nThe Rite of Proving was once a simple trial-by-combat, used to settle disputes between neighbors. However, like the throne, it had been embellished beyond utility. By the end of Calus's  reign, the Rite had been corrupted to allowed advocates, bureaucrats, and politicians to sway its outcome. \n\nDespite Caiatl's contempt for the bygone relics of the failed Cabal Empire, Taurun had prevailed upon the empress to honor them. Not for her own sake, the counselor reasoned, but for the sake of the survivors. \n\n\"Taurun. I've made my decision. We'll put forth Ignovun  as our champion… inside the Halphas Electus . We'll see how much Light the smallmen  have left once they fight their way inside.\" \n\n\"Yes, My Empress.\" Though the wily counselor's face remained implacable, she continued. \"It's my duty to mention that this decision will not be universally welcomed.\" \n\n\"I would have thought you in favor of honoring tradition.\" Caiatl flicked her tusk-ring  in annoyance. \"It's a decision the majority will embrace.\" \n\n\"This is true, My Empress.\" Taurun paused, choosing her next words carefully. \"However, some commanders, like Ixel, the Far-Reaching , believe that victory is close at hand. Leaving the outcome to a Rite of Proving will endanger their glory.\" \n\nCaiatl snorted derisively. \"They would sacrifice us all for a moment of vanity. You know as well as I that we can ill-afford this campaign. We must regroup for an even stronger foe.\" \n\nTaurun hazarded  the slightest of raised eyebrows. \"With respect, it seems as though you value conclusion over victory.\" \n\nCaiatl raised her tusks and lowered her brow. Taurun took a nervous step backward. \n\n\"There's something more important than victory at stake here.\" The empress ran her hands over the ridiculous throne. \"We will honor tradition. We will accept the Rite of Proving. And we will win or lose it as Cabal.\""

All on top of Eliksni and Human confrontations within the City's walls.\n\nA buzzing hum bloomed to life over Zavala's shoulder, followed by the gentle weight of a Ghost that came to settle there. \"Is this the best use of your time?\" Targe wondered aloud, which elicited a look from the corner of Zavala's eye. Targe rarely spoke, but when he did, there was always purpose.\n\n\"I don't recall asking for your opinion,\" Zavala said as he tried to refocus.\n\n\"I don't recall giving one.\"\n\nZavala turned this time to give Targe another look.\n\n\"You two can't keep doing the work of three people,\" Targe insisted. \"Talk to Ana again.\"\n\nZavala leaned back in his chair. \"Targe, there is no way I am going to convince—\" \n\nAn alert chimed at the command console to his right.\n\n\"Incoming call from Empress Caiatl,\" Targe said wearily. \"Let it go to depot.\"\n\nZavala stubbornly rose from his chair. \"No,\" he said, receiving the call. Caiatl's imperial seal appeared on the screen with a notice: AUDIO ONLY.\n\n\"Empress Caiatl, to what do I owe the pleasure?\" Zavala asked, tiredly scratching a hand over his stubble. Targe watched for a moment before he dematerialized. \n\n\"Commander,\" Caiatl greeted, her voice swelling to fill the room as if she were standing there. \"The fleet's long-range sensors detected a growing anomaly located in the vicinity of the Last City.\"\n\n\"Why the sudden concern?\"\n\nCaiatl snorted. \"I bear no concern, Commander. But if the Vanguard were suddenly annihilated, it would behoove me to at least be aware.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Zavala said softly. \"Well, we're still here.\"\n\n\"For now.\"\n\nThe leading edge in her tone hooked him. \"Why are you really calling?\" \n\nThere was no response from the other side for a few moments. When Caiatl spoke next, her tone was as measured as before, but lacked any performative airs. \"Lakshmi-2's latest broadcast to the City reached our fleet,\" she said. \"You are truly a proud hawk standing in a nest of vipers, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Lakshmi is a politician.\" \n\n\"Words are the most dangerous of weapons, Commander,\" Caiatl reminded him. \"It begins as whispering convictions, then full-voiced dissent, and the next thing you know, you will wake with a knife driven into your chest.\"\n\n\"Spoken from experience,\" Zavala jabbed back.\n\n\"Spoken from experience,\" Caiatl doubled down, unashamed. \"Lakshmi is undermining the Vanguard's authority by diminishing your role in the eyes of the people. Spoken loudly enough and often enough, her words may begin to make sense even to those who are not of the same mind.\"\n\nZavala sighed, and Caiatl felt its weight all the way across the system.\n\n\"I trust you to honor the terms of our armistice. I do not trust whomever your successor might be,\" Caiatl warned.\n\nZavala weighed anger and intrigue against one another, finding the scales a useless tool in arbitrating his response to the situation. He stepped back to the console and did as Cayde might say: just wing it.\n\n\"This is not the first threat to my authority I've weathered,\" Zavala said, his voice rising. \"So don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise. And don't you dare come at me for whatever remorse you might be feeling about deposing your father.\"\n\nZavala heard the low rumble of an appreciative vocalization over the speakers. \"I do not feel remorse because Calus was my father,\" Caiatl explained, her tone softening. \"I feel remorse because of what Ghaul did to my people. We opened the door for the Hive, handed Xivu Arath a knife, and were surprised when we felt the kiss of steel in our spine.\"\n\nI hate to see a warrior I admire and respect do the same with a less worthy adversary. But perhaps you are not in need of such unsolicited counsel.\"\n\nZavala looked up, out to the lightless city beyond, and closed his eyes. \"And what counsel is that?\"\n\nWhat Caiatl said next was not in the voice of an empress, but a friend: \"Umun'arath was my most trusted counselor. The Darkness has many hands—will you recognize its caress before it finds your throat?\""

        "text": "Though the metal crate they were carrying likely weighed more than they did, the two Eliksni gave Saint-14 a wide berth on their way to the Eliksni Quarter.\n\n\"You see how they distrust,\" Saint grumbled. Amanda Holliday scanned the crate into her datapad, the unexpected shipment of emergency supplies from the Tangled Shore nearly offloaded.\n\n\"Don't be such a sourpuss,\" she said lightly. \"Mixing with new folk's good for the soul.\"\n\n\"I mix!\" objected Saint. \"But the Fallen… they do not enjoy my company. And I feel the same for them.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's exactly why Ikora picked you for this,\" Amanda said.\n\nThough Saint was fully helmeted, she could swear he rolled his eyes.\n\nTwo more Eliksni came bearing another crate. One noticed Saint too late and stumbled, dropping the crate—its security locks popped as it crashed to the ground. A young Eliksni wearing House of Light colors and a bright orange and blue Vanguard lanyard scampered over in distress.\n\nSaint sighed. \"It is fine,\" he said to the Eliksni. \"Spider probably sends more surplus from old House of Dusk. Knowing you carry supplies from our enemies is great joke to him.\" He dragged the crate out of the walkway with one hand and knelt to repair the locks.\n\nAs Amanda scanned the damaged crate, the young Eliksni came closer. He eyed Saint warily, then held up a sheaf of paper like a shield. \"Manifest,\" he stated haltingly. \n\n\"Thank you,\" Amanda said with unforced brightness. She tapped her datapad. \"I've got it digitally.\"\n\n\"You got it digitally,\" echoed the Eliksni. He fidgeted for a moment, then proudly held up the badge on his lanyard, which read TEMPORARY.\n\nAmanda smiled. \"What've you got there?\"\n\n\"Authorization for unloading of supplies from Tangled Shore. Of supplies sent from Spider,\" he said. He leaned in slowly, looking carefully at Saint and Amanda. \n\n\"My gentlemen,\" he added slyly.\n\nAmanda snorted so abruptly that Saint fumbled with a lock, crushing it in his hand.\n\nSaint looked up. \"Can you two not be quiet?\"\n\n\"C'mon now,\" Amanda admonished Saint lightly. \"I don't hear you practicin' your Eliksni, and this fella's doing his best to bridge the gap.\" \n\nAmanda turned back to the Eliksni. \"That ain't exactly right, but you speak our language pretty well,\" she said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" answered the Eliksni, clearly eager for conversation. \"Do all Humans here serve Spiderkell?\"\n\n\"Serve Spider?\" Amanda spat. \"Spider's nothing but a—\" and the five spirited words that followed were replete with hard consonants. \n\nThe Eliksni froze, wary of her tone while not understanding her words.\n\nAmanda caught herself and took a breath. \"…which is our way of saying he's a kind and generous individual,\" she said to the Eliksni, who nodded along with her.\n\n\"This lock has been ruined by distractions,\" Saint said as he rose to his feet. He removed the lid and looked inside, then lifted a loose coil of rubbery tubes. \n\n\"Servitor plugs, filters, Ether circulators…\" The Titan made a confused noise.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Amanda asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" mumbled Saint as he picked up a small golden cylinder trailing braided sapphire cords. \"This rebreather alone is worth more than my ship.\" \n\nAmanda moved toward Saint and looked for herself. She recognized a few necessary survival items—condensed prefab ceramic plating, vapor distillers, generator couplings—but amongst the tubes and filters were otherworldly treasures: A nanomesh sphere filled with thick pink liquid. A chrome conduit splitter with entropic plating. A glimmering opal sparkling in a nest of delicate lavender sponges. \n\n\"The hell is Spider playing at?\" Amanda said to herself. She called out to the Eliksni: \"Are they all like this?\" \n\n\"Yes. Each one is very full. Full of delights, from our culture. From our home. We are very thanks.\" He cocked his head and clicked. \"Thankful?\"\n\nAmanda nodded. \"Let me see that manifest,\" she said, taking the papers from the Eliksni. He nodded and rejoined the other workers.\n\n\"They will still need many of our resources to stay here,\" Saint said as he carefully resealed the crate, \"but this will make things easier. I am surprised Spider is so generous, even to his own people.\"\n\nAmanda frowned at the manifest. \"This doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"There's a note at the top: 'Don't know what half this stuff is, but it's got to be good if Spider had it.' It's all written by hand, and there aren't values for anything on here.\"\n\nSaint looked at the papers over Amanda's shoulder. \"The crates came from Spider's storehouse,\" he said. \"If he did not send them, who did?\"\n\n\"Look at this listing!\" Amanda continued. \"This item says 'best osmosis filters (hidden in his bottom drawer).' This item is just a row of question marks. Here's one listed as 'a clock thing.' This line says 'noisy cube: smells bad but everybody likes it.' And what's with this signature?\"\n\nAmanda squinted at the shape scrawled at the bottom of the form. \"It's a… ship?\" she guessed, handing the paper to Saint.\n\nThe Titan turned his head as he looked at the drawing. \"Aha!\" he cried, slapping the paper with the back of his hand. \"Look, is bird!\"\n\nAmanda looked again at the uneven charcoal lines and could just make out a wobbly black bird. She let out a long breath and shook her head. \"Awful artist,\" she said, \"but I guess he's an all right guy.\" And suddenly, she was smiling."

The pair had been wandering around the massive Hangar for an hour while an enormous ship was being loaded in the background.\n\nJalaal had seen the celestial disappearances and the encroachment of the Black Fleet as clear signs that Dead Orbit's final exodus must soon begin. He had ordered a redoubling of departure preparations, but found the faction's rank-and-file struggling to keep pace. \n\nJalaal cut off his subordinate's bumbling presentation. \"This is insufficient. Earth will soon be behind us, and Dead Orbit will have to survive on the supplies that we provide.\" His mild tone and half-lidded gaze underscored the gravity of his words. \"Supplies that you are in charge of tracking. You do understand that, don't you?\" \n\nA furious blush spread across the administrator's face. He bowed his head and scuttled away as Jalaal crooked his head in annoyance. \n\nBehind him, a raspy voice floated up from the maze of towering crates: \"Leaving us so soon, Jalaal?\" \n\nHe turned to find Lakshmi-2 and Executor Hideo. The Future War Cult leader stood formally, hands clasped before her, while the head of New Monarchy browsed the shipping crates with casual interest. \n\n\"This is an impressive collection. I had no idea Dead Orbit was so well funded.\" Hideo gestured broadly to the crates. \n\nJalaal shrugged. \"It's a life's work, Hideo. Everything we'll need to re-seed the Human species elsewhere. You should join us.\" \n\n\"We're fine where we are, thank you,\" Lakshmi interjected. \"As a matter of fact, that's why we've come.\" \n\nJalaal bowed his head and gestured toward the Hangar exit. The trio ambled outside. \n\n\"Hideo and I are concerned about the current Vanguard leadership,\" Lakshmi began carefully. \n\nJalaal allowed himself a mirthless chuckle. \"Yes, I've heard your open editorials. You're becoming quite the demagogue. I never knew you held such strong feelings about the Fallen.\"  \n\n\"If it's incitement to speak the truth, then so be it,\" Lakshmi fired back, sharper than intended. \"The Fallen have been a useful catalyst, but that doesn't mean we are wrong.\" \n\n\"Perhaps not about the Vanguard,\" Jalaal replied, \"but the Cult is hemorrhaging members. And I doubt it's your best and brightest remaining.\" \n\n\"Those who wish to leave are free to do so,\" Lakshmi said with a pointed glance toward the Dead Orbit ship. \"We'll be stronger without them.\" \n\n\"Zavala and Ikora have been ineffective since the Speaker died,\" Executor Hideo cut in. \"The disappearance of the planets caught them unprepared. They're allowing Guardians to use the Darkness. And now they've cut a deal with the Cabal?  It's just too much.\" \n\n\"We must have leadership whose point of view is more closely aligned to that of the people,\" Lakshmi said. \n\n\"And who do you propose, exactly?\" Jalaal stopped the trio at the corner of a broad thoroughfare, where the rumble of cargo movers masked their conversation. \n\n\"Saladin was our first choice,\" Hideo added with an ill-concealed smirk, \"but he's not as cutthroat as he seems. Appears the Iron Lord has a soft spot for Commander Zavala.\" \n\nLakshmi gave Hideo a look, as though he had revealed too much. \"We are now considering Saint-14,\" she said, pointedly bringing the conversation back to the present. \n\nJalaal raised an eyebrow. \"Who else is committed to your little coup?\"  \n\n\"We have somebody in a position of influence. Someone who can ensure an orderly transfer of power,\" Lakshmi answered. \n\n\"That person would have to be very clever indeed,\" Jalaal said gravely. \"For your sake. Ikora Rey is not a target to miss.\"\n\nThe moment stretched as Jalaal measured the situation. He had long considered what a change of leadership might mean for Dead Orbit; for the resettlement and survival of the Human species. And as always, the allure of personal power—a position of eminence in a dying society—was a constant temptation."

Some were armed with weapons, though most carried workaday tools like crowbars and wrenches.\n\nThey planned to infiltrate the Eliksni Quarter and find evidence of aggression. If that failed, they would send a clear message that the House of Light was unwelcome in the Last City. Knives tore into banners. Noxious fumes filled the air. Paint cans rattled. The hum of the machinery around them disguised the sounds of their labor while hushed voices conferred in terse, conspiratorial tones. \n\n\"I think this is their food,\" a young woman whispered to her male companion while warily looking over her shoulder. She didn't see anyone as they crouched by a large Ether tank, but she imagined the Eliksni crowded together in a nearby building. Did they even sleep? \n\n\"Here, give me a hand with this,\" her companion said, pointing to what he guessed was a control panel. \n\nTogether they pried the face plate off, revealing a mess of wiring beneath. They shared a furtive glance and began pulling out wires by the fistful, hands shaky, their blood pounding in their ears. \n\nA low whistle like a bird call fluttered through the night air. When they looked up, a Hunter stood over them only a few paces away, his face shadowed by a cowl. He held his Hand Cannon at hip level, aimed straight at them. \n\nTheir co-conspirators, drawn by the sound, gathered in their periphery, mentally calculating their chances. Not a single one liked the odds. Even those who came armed expected to fight the Fallen, not a Guardian. \n\nThe Hunter called out in a half-whisper: \"I don't want any trouble.\" \n\nThe woman stood frozen as the young man beside her moved toward the Hunter, his jaw set. \"No!\" his companion hissed. \"Are you crazy?\" She grabbed his arm to haul him behind the ruined Ether tank, but he wrenched free. \n\nThe young man stepped slowly toward the Hunter. \"You're on the wrong side of this thing,\" he started. \n\nThe Hunter pulled back on his Hand Cannon's hammer with an audible click. \n\n\"I don't think I am,\" he replied. \n\nUnwilling to test the Hunter's mettle, the young man called over his shoulder. \"Let's go.\" \n\nThe Hunter narrowed his eyes. He watched as the young man slinked past him and spat at his feet. Something old and terrible rose up inside of the Hunter; it took all of his focus to steady his hand. \n\nThe conspirators peeled away from their hiding places, one by one, disappearing into the dark. Some hissed choice insults and dispersions at the Hunter under their breath, though none dared to look at him. \n\nIn just a few minutes, the block was deserted except for the Hunter, who stood alone in the street until his Ghost complied over his shoulder. \n\nIt chirped with concern. \"You wouldn't really have shot them, right?\" \n\nThe Hunter hesitated as he holstered his weapon. \"They needed to know I was serious, Glint.\" \n\n\"But you weren't,\" his Ghost insisted. Wordlessly, the Hunter began making his way through the destruction. Someone would sound the alarm soon—he didn't want to be there when they did. \n\n\"Tell me you weren't serious,\" his Ghost said again, lagging behind, \"…were you?\""

Wires climbed like vines across the ceiling, and the air was filled with the faint smell of ozone. In the middle of the room, reclining on a seat reminiscent of both throne and operating table, was Lakshmi-2. Her face was obscured by a helmet that connected to the mess of wiring above.\n\nStudious Cultists shuffled about with their heads bowed, glancing suspiciously at Ikora. As the Warlock advanced, a Cultist held up a single finger, commanding both silence and patience. Ikora's eyes narrowed. The Cultist whispered into a small microphone next to the Device. Its subaudible hum had been inconspicuous, but once it powered down, the quiet felt overwhelming to Ikora. \n\nLakshmi sat in repose, presumably orienting herself in the current timeline. \"Leave us,\" she said without opening her eyes. \"We'll resume at 14:25.\" Her subordinates filtered from the room, looking past Ikora as if she were invisible. \n\nLakshmi finally opened her eyes, and fixed them on the Warlock. \"I assume you're here to bargain.\" \n\n\"I'm not.\" Ikora's tone was calm and cold. \"I'm here to issue a warning of my own.\" \n\n\"Warn me?\" Lakshmi laughed, her voice thin. \n\n\"If we have any further incidents on account of your incitement, I will personally find a remote, icy moon to leave you on.\" \n\n Lakshmi tutted. \"Only small minds classify prophecy as provocation.\" She stood up and smoothed her garments. \n\n\"Certainty in the face of the unknown is the provenance of zealots.\" Ikora eyed the Device. \"And the insane. This isn't a debate.\" \n\n\"And yet, you are still here. Come, Ikora, you've not seen what I have.\" Lakshmi gestured to the Device. \"The Botza District under assault for a second time. Saint-14, pinned down by gunfire. And you…\" she trailed off, \"screaming for help over the comms.\" \n\n\"How many of your prophecies have gone unfulfilled, Lakshmi?\" Ikora snapped. \"I wish you could hear yourself; how afraid you sound.\" \n\n\"All those years studying under Osiris, and you're still so naïve,\" Lakshmi replied. \n\nIkora's anger flared. She advanced on the Cult leader. \"Cut the B.S., or suffer the consequences. Understand?\" \n\nUndaunted, Lakshmi's artificial eyes shone bright. \"Understood.\" \n\nIkora stepped back and let her anger pass out of her with a sigh. \"Then we're done here.\" She turned on her heels and strode out. \n\nAs she left, Ikora wondered whose prophecy she had just fulfilled—Lakshmi's or her own."

I look up toward the false dusk I have hung, but it is not yet finished. \n\nI am afraid, but it is thrilling to engage in something new after all this time, something unknown. I close my eyes tightly so they do not bulge.\n\nThe feeling passes. I open my eyes and search the faces of the people around me for familiarity. I did not mean to. I twist inwardly with disgust.\n\nWhen they first reached for me, I reached back in acid mockery, and they opened themselves to me in stupid, naked innocence. I was giddy. My fingers raked their minds. I forced my will through them using only words and met no resistance. Their naiveté was beyond description, and I feasted until my eyes welled with black tears.\n\nNow I reach as often as they do, and when they reach back, I am thankful.\n\nI speak with them.

He points a finger at me in mocking admonishment before walking away.\n\nI swallow the fatty morsel of his ignorance and it gives me the strength to stand once more, cover my face, and resume my walk. I feel this form splitting beneath its wrappings, held together weakly by wet strands of sinew. And from deep inside, stirred by that latest scrap of deception, I hear the oily growl of the Worm.\n\nEven here, basted in deception both ample and rich, the Worm cries ravenously.

In times of celebration, it was a parade ground meant to extol the virtues of the Guardians and show the people of the City the faces of their often-distant defenders. To see it empty was almost unheard of since the Red War.\n\nExecutor Hideo of New Monarchy walked alongside Lakshmi-2 of Future War Cult, observing vendor stalls decorated in neon lights that flickered intermittently as they passed. But there were no vendors, no proprietors. Hideo glanced over his shoulder at the four Future War Cult security officers that followed behind them at a respectful distance.\n\n\"Do you remember the last time this street was empty?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Lakshmi said with a heavy heart. \"They called me a fool then as well.\" She did nothing to hide the contempt in her voice. \"We make mistakes in circles, Hideo. Walking in a loop of our own self-made despair.\"\n\nBefore he could formulate a response, Hideo spotted the reason for their walk through the Endless Night: a towering behemoth of chrome and lavender cloth, hunched over in an abandoned plaza.\n\nSaint-14 focused on the birds underfoot, scattering a handmade mix of seed on the ground while he cooed contentedly at the pigeons. \"You have chosen poor night for walk,\" he observed as Hideo and Lakshmi approached. \"Do you need escort back to Tower?\"\n\nHideo shook his head. \"No, Saint. We went to find you in the Hangar, and Ms. Holliday informed us that you had come here to…\" He eyed the birds. \"…contemplate.\"\n\n\"Birds are uncomplicated. Good conversationalists. They give me room to think,\" Saint said with a smile in his voice. \"How can I help?\"\n\n\"The Consensus has struggled, as of late, with some of the Vanguard's decisions regarding the City's security. We wanted to expand that conversation to include you,\" Lakshmi said.\n\n\"But not Arach Jalaal?\" Saint asked, a more pointed and cunning response than either Hideo or Lakshmi anticipated.\n\n\"No,\" Hideo quickly confirmed. \n\nLakshmi verbally maneuvered around Hideo's answer like water around a stone. \"This is about ensuring that the best interests of the City are at the forefront of the Vanguard's mind.\"\n\nSaint fixed his helmed visage on Lakshmi. \"The Eliksni.\" A statement, not a question.\n\n\"The Vanguard are a military force, and the Consensus does not doubt their commitment to defending the City beyond its borders.\" Lakshmi carefully worded her approach. \"But we have come to doubt that a military force is the best governance for the City inside of its walls.\"\n\nSaint squared his shoulders as if presented a challenge and looked between Hideo and Lakshmi. His stoicism twisted Hideo's stomach into knots.\n\n\"We would like to propose a restructuring of the City's leadership. Placing the Vanguard as the authority for what goes on outside the walls…\" Hideo gestured toward the mountains. \"And respective leadership here inside the City.\" He motioned to Saint.\n\n\"This is bad plan,\" Saint said without any attempt at obfuscating his feelings.\n\n\"Surely you understand that tactical options in the field do not always apply unilaterally in a civilian quarter,\" Hideo pleaded. \"On top of that, the Vanguard is stretched too thin. They cannot be the leadership they need to be.\"\n\nSaint balked. \"Then why come to me? I am no politician.\"\n\n\"But you are a leader,\" Lakshmi countered as she placed a hand over her chest. \"A hero. A symbol to the people.\"\n\nSaint drew in a steady breath and grew silent. \n\n\"It may not feel like the right choice because of your personal feelings toward Commander Zavala and Ikora. Change can sometimes feel distasteful. But I know you aren't one to ignore your sense of duty.\"\n\nSaint looked down at his feet, at the birds, at the seed. \"I must speak with Osiris,\" he asserted.\n\nLakshmi briefly regarded Hideo and nodded. \"Give your partner our regards.\"\n\n\"I will,\" Saint said stiffly, scattering the last of the seed in his hand to the birds before departing the plaza.\n\nHideo and Lakshmi waited under the watchful eye of the Traveler until Saint was gone.\n\n\"If he tells Zavala or Ikora…\" Hideo said through clenched teeth.\n\n\"Osiris will stop him from doing anything so stupid,\" Lakshmi said, the softness in her voice gone. \"And if he is so shortsighted as to refuse us as Saladin did…\"\n\nHideo's stomach twisted again."

A small gaggle of children stood across the way, clearly interested in the robots as they moved aimlessly, but too frightened to approach.  Lakshmi knew that the peddler would sell one of the robots, but none of the scrap, and end the day discouraged.\n\nIt's a bright new day, she thought. \n\n\"It's a bright new day,\" a deep voice called out. Lakshmi turned to see the former Warlock Osiris striding along the wall toward her. \n\n\"What a strange choice of words,\" Lakshmi answered. \"The Darkness is closer than ever.\" And in the darkness, it's sometimes difficult to tell friend from foe. She remembered this conversation from her time in the Device. Many of the potential futures it showed her led to this moment. Osiris was growing predictable. \n\n\"It is,\" Osiris said. \"And in the darkness, it's hard to tell friend from foe.\" \n\nLakshmi smiled inwardly. They were still well within the standard deviation. \"I'm surprised to hear you say that, Osiris. You are normally blessed with such uncommon clarity.\" \n\n\"My perspective has changed since I lost the Light,\" Osiris began slowly. \"Time is suddenly finite. It makes everything seem more… changeable. And if my perception can change, perhaps my enemies can as well.\" \n\n\"The folly of mortality.\" Lakshmi gestured to the scene below. \"Those people could never understand time as we do, Osiris. You've peered behind the veil. You've seen the Vex simulations stretching endlessly. You understand that history is changeable… but also inevitable.\" \n\n\"I used to be certain of that,\" he agreed. \"But now I have to wonder, if history is inevitable, why am I constantly surprised?\" \n\nLakshmi chuckled. She had heard his comment before, of course, but her premonition had not adequately conveyed his fatuousness. \n\n\"And what do you think, Osiris? Will this bright new day last?\" She nodded toward the Eliksni settlement. \"Are we meant to share the Light with the Fallen?\" \n\nAs if you would know, she thought. You no longer deal in predictions. \n\n\"I've given up on prediction, Lakshmi. I put my fate in the hands of the Traveler now more than ever before.\" He gave her a sidelong glance. \"And what do you say? Is this a new dawn?\" \n\nLakshmi recalled the vision she had so fervently sought within the Device. The realization of her righteous victory over the Eliksni—historical and preordained all at once.

Urged forward by a gentle nudge, the child gingerly placed a gilded eggshell at the memorial's base. Gold soldering sealed a myriad of fractures, making a once broken egg whole again.

The Dreg and his son approached, and with a bittersweet smile, Ikora made certain to introduce them to Zavala. Big, stern, stoic Zavala took to one knee and spoke to the child, eye to eye.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see the day,\" Saint finally said, unable to look away.\n\nMithrax responded, not with words, but with a fluttering purr-like rumble and mirrored Saint's posture.\n\n\"Do you think this will hold? An alliance, fragile like glass, held in a fist?\" Saint asked.\n\n\"Only the Great Machine knows what will come from over the horizon. We must be content with our own limited perspectives,\" Mithrax said with conviction.\n\nSaint nodded. Down below, Amanda Holliday drew their attention as she knelt before the memorial to light a candle. She stood and stepped back, lingering. Mithrax and Saint watched in silence as she rose up on her toes and began scanning through the crowd. As if she were looking for someone.\n\nShe gently pushed through the throng of people and reached out to another mourner in a white cloak. Both recoiled in surprise, Amanda seemingly apologizing to the cloaked woman at some misunderstanding. They exchanged brief words, awkward laughs, sympathies. When Amanda caught sight of Lord Saladin, however, she took her leave and disappeared into the crowd.\n\nMourners parted around the Iron Lord, respectful of his space and reputation as he laid a handful of spent shell casings at the memorial with reverence. The offering's meaning was lost on Mithrax.\n\nWhen Saladin rose from the memorial, he turned and looked up at the pair on the overwatch, his face cast in shades of doubt, remorse, and uncertainty as he quietly departed.\n\n\"I do not know that one,\" Mithrax said with a look to Saint. \"He seems… unhappy.\"\n\nSaint slowly shook his head. \"Lord Saladin,\" he clarified. \"He has lost many. Lost his heart, his hope. Lost so many, he believes he stands alone, even when surrounded by others. I understand his pain. I see…\" Saint thinks on how Osiris would describe it. \"…his cautionary tale.\"\n\nMithrax heard the ache in Saint's voice. \"And how are you?\"\n\nSaint tensed at the question. The railing in his hand creaked as his grip tightened and bent the metal. \"I am fine,\" he lied.\n\n\"Indeed,\" Mithrax said with his best affectation of sarcasm, then placed a hand on Saint's shoulder. \"It is not above a warrior's station to feel pain. Not above a warrior's station to express spirit-wounds.\" Mithrax's grip firmed on Saint's shoulder; reassuring, stabilizing. \"Not above a warrior's station to break.\"\n\nSaint nodded in half-hearted agreement. \"I should go,\" he said in a tone Mithrax didn't quite understand. \"Thank you, Kell of Kells. You are true friend.\"\n\n\"Go well, Saint,\" Mithrax said with concern. \"Find your lost phoenix.\""

        "text": "Caiatl stands on the bridge of her flagship, six destroyer-class warcraft at her flanks. Weeks of intelligence and a handful of dead spies have brought her to a single point in space. This moment of opportunity.\n\nA massive, reinforced viewport extends from beneath her feet to the ceiling of the bridge. Through it, dead-still azure banners obscure the distant Awoken Reef. From Caiatl's perspective, it appears as a slurry of glitz and dust to be swept away at her command—an idea her advisors spoke of all too frequently. Their soft conflict with one city had left some eager for a decisive victory in another. It was a distraction.\n\nIn the space between Caiatl and the Reef, just beyond the unmoving banners, malachite-licked wisps of intent tear open the space between her and the shimmering dust. Long black spindles of Hive workmanship pierce the rift first, preceding a massive Tomb Carrier twice the size of her flagship.\n\nCaiatl addresses her bridge officers. \"Wait until they're through and cannot flee.\"\n\nHer destroyers take up flanking positions opposite of her own as Caiatl orders her flagship to maneuver above the massive Tomb Carrier.\n\nWhen the rift shuts, the order comes over Cabal comms: \"Strike.\"\n\nThe six destroyers spring their diversionary attack. Caiatl feels the pressure waves from their silent cannons wash over her as their shells detonate. Tomb Carrier and Cabal warcraft exchange a harrowing gauntlet of ordnance. The diversion is working.\n\n\"Point us straight at their midsection. Launch ballista crews,\" Caiatl barks. \"Inform me when they've taken the bridge.\"\n\nEmerald flare wells deep in the Tomb Carrier's main gun like a brewing cauldron lined with obsidian teeth. The barrel: a massive column of vertebrae from some leviathan creature, ignites with ten thousand Hive runes. The Tomb Carrier belches streams of malefic flame that effortlessly obliterates two spearheading Cabal destroyers. Caiatl steps forward in horror as their hulls erupt in a series of soulfire explosions.\n\n\"Don't let that gun fire again! Protect our destroyers!\" She pivots to her navigation office. \"Bring the ship to minimum jump speed. Full power to the mains!\"\n\nCaiatl thrusts a finger at the Tomb Carrier. \"Engage the Aries ram and prepare for impact!\"\n\nThe flagship hurtles toward the Tomb Carrier, unleashing a full salvo of cannons and warheads to soften the Carrier's carapace.\n\nCaiatl turns to a bridge crew Legionary as the Tomb Carrier rapidly expands in the viewport behind her. \"Fetch my shield.\"\n\n***\n\nOn the other side of the Reef, Queen Mara Sov watches through a Dreaming City aperture as the battle unfolds on her borders. The inscrutable expression on her face twists with each distant explosion. Petra wishes the small tensing motions would give some indication of what her queen is thinking. Instead, she sees only the cold stare of one predator assessing the size and strength of another.\n\nPetra looks to the knife Mara is idly toying with and notices a detail she hadn't before: a pair of kestrels etched into the blade, wings intertwined, linework so fine that she has to squint to recognize their silhouettes.\n\nPetra frowns. \"My queen?\" she asks, but Mara does not shift her attention from the battle.\n\n\"Caiatl's war games will keep Xivu Arath occupied while we focus on recovering our lost Techeuns,\" Mara says. She uses the point of the knife to trace the longest line along her palm. \"Neither will be able to launch a full-scale attack on the Dreaming City while the other is at her throat.\"\n\n\"Savathûn first?\" ventures Petra.\n\nMara's stoic façade cracks. She looks down at the blade, at the twin kestrels, and sees something in her own reflection that unsettles her.\n\n\"Savathûn first,\" she agrees, sheathing the weapon so she doesn't have to think about it."

The system is in a volatile state.\" \n\nSaint sighs. \"There is not a Guardian in the Tower who does not wish to ask me about Osiris. I cannot, Geppetto.\" \n\n\"Then do not ask a Guardian,\" Geppetto presses.\n\nMithrax is finishing repairs on a Shank when he sees Saint-14 transmat into the Botza District. He watches the Saint greet a pair of Eliksni startled by his materialization. He watches the Guardian bow and the Eliksni hesitantly bow back. Saint-14 catches Mithrax's gaze and extends an arm toward him, as if asking permission to enter his workshop. It is not needed. \n\nMithrax stands and welcomes Saint-14 as he crosses the threshold. \n\n\"Vell-ahsk,\" Saint manages. \n\nMithrax chatters. \"Velask, Saint.\" \n\n\"May we speak alone?\" \n\n\"Of course.\" Mithrax shuts and latches a door clearly transplanted from a Ketch. \"Speak freely.\"\n\n\"I would not normally come to you asking for favors,\" Saint says, pacing.\n\n\"House Light will aid you if we are able.\"\n\nSaint nods to himself. \"Osiris, the real Osiris—Savathûn took his form and hid him away. Or so she says.\"\n\nMithrax bows his head. \"The true Osiris is innocent? All is not as dire as we presumed.\"\n\n\"So it would seem. I need to find Osiris. I want to take away the Witch Queen's leverage. When she is broken, the Reef Queen can have her,\" Saint growls.\n\n\"Mara Sov has returned?\" Mithrax drags sharply on his rebreather. \"Grand pieces are in motion. How do I assist?\"\n\n\"I am searching for the exact spot Sagira fell. Savathûn captured him there, I know it,\" Saint says.\n\n\"The name Sagira was spoken often in House of Wolves, with respect. House Dusk told all Houses Sagira fell on Earth's moon, but I know not where. May she find peace in the Light.\"\n\n\"She is missed.\" Saint holds a moment in reverence. \"Osiris's last transmission was from beneath the Moon's surface. But the Pyramid's interference made it impossible to determine the exact location. It is too large an area to search.\"\n\n\"Hive machines are without spirits. Morbid constructs a Splicer's gauntlet cannot access for information,\" Mithrax says apologetically. \"But I wish to help the Saint, as the Saint helped Misraaks and House Light.\" \n\n\"Then… your company would be appreciated as I search.\"\n\nMithrax is lost in thought momentarily before his eyes sharpen. \"The Vex on Europa kept records of defeated Guardians. And likely, Ghosts. It may be possible to find Sagira's gravesite using their network.\"\n\n\"What?\" Saint exclaims.\n\n\"Perhaps it is their proximity to Darkness that causes them to do so. But Misraaks has seen such records, as I explored their network for knowledge to affix Splicer technology to Guardian arms.\"\n\n\"You sound like a Warlock, so I trust you. Show me how we do this.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Europa,\" Saint mutters. \"Could we not have gone somewhere warmer?\" he asks, dismounting his Ram Sparrow on a cliff overlooking the Asterion Abyss. \"I am used to the simulated sun of Mercury.\"\n\nMithrax dismounts beside Saint. \"Vex apertures on Europa afford unique opportunity. We seek an invitation into that opportunity.\"\n\nSaint rolls his shoulders. \"We crush Vex Mind and use its brain like key. Yes, yes. This is not news to me. You forget I spent many years in Infinite Forest.\"\n\n\"A brutal, but apt description.\" Mithrax chitters to himself. \"We will have to draw out a Vex Mind. The override integration here remains active. The Light provides.\"\n\n\"You splice computer hole. I crush the Mind.\" Saint starts to walk forward but then halts abruptly. \"Do not drop me into computer hole.\"\n\n\"Misraaks will warn the Saint first.\"\n\n \"You better.\" Saint turns to the Eliksni. \"I joke about the cold, Light-friend, but I am glad to have you here.\"\n\n\"I share in your glad, Saint.\"\n\nThey walk together. Swiftly, Mithrax forges the integration. As they come under fire, a violet refuge takes hold around him—he stands within the Saint's Ward, fearless and with clear sight.\n\nThe Vex are numerous. They too know the Saint. He lives up to their records. The Mind is broken."

He places his forehead against the shrine, smudging a freshly bloodied sigil of Xivu Arath. He has added so many layers, but this is the first time the blood is his own. He does so to show his devotion. To reject the heretic sister. To pledge himself anew to war.\n\nThe Ascendant sky churns around him. He breaths deeply. It is his first breath of this life. He looks to the shrine before him; every vanquished contender ground to meal and packed between skulls to cement them in place. Trinkets of conquest and old spent weapons adorn the shrine from base to apex.\n\nHe looks to them as he prepares to face his adversary.\n\nAn empty Ghost whose core he had gifted to defected Scarlet Wizards. Its Guardian had ended him many times, but he is Kelgorath, and through battle he is reborn. No Guardian can escape him, for they are heralds of death and he swims in their wake.\n\nHis eyes drift to another conquest: crystalline implants torn from the forehead of an Awoken Techeun. He hunted her through the Ley Lines for three days, tracking her by the stench of her fear. When he found her, she brought the Ascendant Plane down on him. He did not fall for this trick twice.\n\nHe caught her again with his next life. The Techeun's final words echoed in his thoughts: \"I still see the flecks of scarlet in your chitin. How quickly you abandon your Witch Queen.\"\n\nKelgorath recalls the night he renounced Savathûn. The night he had scoured the scarlet from his flesh on the serration beds deep within the Hellmouth. The night Osiris slaughtered all Crota's kin. Savathûn was weak to allow their deaths. To cede ground to the Celebrant; to Guardians. Xivu Arath avenged them. Xivu Arath took Osiris's Light, and Kelgorath guzzled from it with vows of vengeance.\n\nHe would prove his allegiance by stamping out any trace of the heretic sister. Hurdru, his adversary, was a Knight who still claimed fealty to Savathûn; Hurdru would be an instrument of example. Through battle, Kelgorath would confirm his new god. Through blood, he would erase the name Savathûn and don that of Xivu Arath.\n\nHe stands. Bows. Grips the cleaver and shield he will carry until he falls again. \"Hurdru,\" he whispers to the bones.\n\nTonight, he will purify himself in death."

This place draws his old self out.\" She pauses, knowing Petra will be silent while allowing her to steep in the words. \"You saw it, too. He should have never been allowed to leave.\"\n\n\"I wish I hadn't,\" Petra says with a heavy sigh. \"How am I to proceed?\"\n\nMara stands on the terrace above her. \"Give him only morsels of who he could be, nothing substantial.

She stands with her arms crossed tightly over her chest. \"He suffered through an eternity of battle to keep us safe. Then he comes to the Tower and lets his guard down—lets himself care for someone—and that's when he gets hurt.\"\n\nShe grimaces. \"Badly.\"\n\nZavala shifts in his chair and runs his large hands over his desk. His palms have memorized its every bump, every groove. \"I'm giving him space, but I don't know what else I can do.

He just has to do something.\"\n\n\"I can understand that feeling,\" Ikora says quietly. \"That's what I should have been doing. Seeing things my Hidden missed. Out in the field, putting the pieces together.\"\n\nHer lip curls in disgust. \"Not wasting time in the Tower, waiting for an attack.\"\n\nZavala looks up at her and frowns. \"It's not like you to second-guess yourself.\"\n\nIkora's jaw tightens. Bitter fire flickers in her eyes. \"Maybe I should.\" Her voice is brittle. \"I brought Osiris—Savathûn—inside our walls.\"\n\n\"Yes, as you did with Mithrax and the House of Light,\" Zavala counters evenly.\n\nBut Ikora lowers her eyes. \"People died for that too.\"\n\nAs Zavala rises from his seat, she turns away; the last thing she wants is to be comforted. She hears him lean against his desk, and a patient silence fills the room.\n\nFinally, Ikora lets her arms fall to her sides. When she looks at Zavala, his expression is one of confusion rather than concern.\n\n\"It's been years since I've heard you talk like this,\" he says.\n\nFrustration rises in her. \"I looked in his eyes and didn't see it.\"\n\n\"Neither did I. None of us did.\"\n\nZavala's face looks almost serene, which makes Ikora want to hurl a Nova Bomb into it.\n\n\"Listen,\" he says. \"We have conquered the Cabal in their arenas. We have chased the Hive into their Ascendant Planes; the Vex deep into their network. We have been tricked by the god of trickery, and we have fought the god of war on the battlefield.\"\n\nZavala's mouth tightens into a grim line. \"When we go up against gods, we fight them on their terms. That usually means we take the first hit. We can't choose when that happens, but we can make damn sure we're the ones left standing.\"\n\nHe sits back down at his desk and racks a sheaf of papers, as if putting a period on his sentence. Ikora clasps her hands behind her back, then takes a long breath. \n\n\"I'll support him as best I can,\" she says. \"Share all my intel on Osiris—anything we learned while my Hidden were shadowing Crow after he first rose. If Savathûn left a trail, I'll find it.\"\n\n\"I know you will,\" Zavala says.\n\nIkora allows his words to reach her. \"I wish there was a way to get him back,\" she says quietly.\n\n\"Saint or Osiris?\" Zavala asks, looking up.\n\nThe hem of Ikora's robe whispers softly across the floor as she leaves the office."

        "text": "Space is loneliness. Far removed from any of the system's planets, it is at once suffocatingly dark and blindingly bright depending on which way you turn. A jumpship sits in a fixed position in the black, engines off, oriented so its underbelly faces the glare of the distant sun.\n\nThere is no true cockpit inside the Radiant Accipiter; the ship's canopy projects an image to the pilot. No frame, no obstructions, just the infinite gulf. Crow stares up at the blackness between a cluster of stars he can't identify; he wishes he were there. Where nothing is known, where everything can be new again.\n\nGlint rests in his Guardian's lap. He's accustomed to Crow's hands cradling him as though he were a small cat—but in this moment, Crow's head is instead in his hands, fingers tangled in his hair.\n\nGlint is silent, patient. He knows he has to be.\n\nCrow makes a small sound in the back of his throat and the Ghost stirs. When this is followed by an unsteady hitch in his breathing, Glint floats up, presses himself to Crow's chest, and begins to hum.\n\nCrow's hands close around him, clutching him against his heart.\n\nAnd that's how Glint knows: Crow is still the same inside.\n\n***\n\nSulfurous plumes rise from fissures in the Venusian soil. Crow marches across the planet's surface, his boots crushing thin sheets of calcium that skim across shallow, iridescent pools of water. His jumpship is perched atop a rise nearby, clear of the unstable field he now traverses.\n\n\"Crow, please,\" Glint pleads over his Guardian's shoulder. \"Can you tell me why we're here?\"\n\nAhead, clouds of light and geometric shapes bloom into being. Glint lets out a sharp gasp and transmats away as Crow reaches for the hand cannon at his side. By the time the first Vex Goblin manifests, Crow has already trained his sights on it.\n\nA single pull of the trigger takes the machine's head off and sends it staggering across the field, firing blindly. Two more Goblins appear nearby and Crow blasts away their limbs like a child separating a fly from its wings. He ends them with the last bullets in the cylinder.\n\nA shimmer of violet light within the temporal storm heralds the arrival of a Vex Minotaur. It bellows a roar across the Venusian flats and fires a volley of energized plasma through the air. Crow weaves between them, tumbles forward through the shallow pools, and rises to his feet to shake out his hand cannon's cylinder, sending brass shell casings raining to the ground.\n\nThe Minotaur revises its place in history, appearing to teleport forward as it shifts to a more advantageous future. It closes in on Crow before he can finish reloading and grabs him by the head, hefting him off his feet. The Minotaur raises its plasma cannon to Crow's chest and—\n\n***\n\nCrow sucks in a sharp breath and his eyes open to winged serpents circling in the cloudy Venusian sky. He coughs violently, rolling onto his side. The Vex are gone.\n\n\"That was stupid,\" Glint chastises suddenly, and Crow remembers where—and when—he is. \"Why didn't you use your Light?\"\n\n\"I wanted to test something,\" Crow says on sharp exhale. He pushes himself to his feet, only to find Glint an inch in front of his nose.\n\n\"What could you possibly be testing all the way out here?\" the little Ghost asks, looking around the desolate landscape. Then, the question Glint doesn't want to ask: \"Were you trying to hurt yourself?\"\n\n\"No,\" Crow seethes. He nudges Glint to the side and starts to head back for the jumpship, but Glint persists.\n\n\"Then why?\" he demands, blocking Crow's path.\n\n\"Because I wanted to know I was still me!\" Crow snarls, his teeth bared in a display of fury. \"Uldren Sov could defeat a Minotaur without the Light.\" His hackles lower. \"I needed—I need to be sure that I'm not him. That you could still bring me back. That I was still—worthy of this !\"\n\nGlint's monocular eye bobs down to look at the ground. He is silent.\n\nThis time, Crow doesn't try to push past him. He stands still, listening to the blast of distant geysers, to the call of serpents in the sky.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Glint whispers."

Her words lack heat but echo through the cavernous chamber nonetheless. \"I just want to be absolutely clear on this: I hate you, and I wish nothing but pain and suffering for the rest of your miserable existence.\"\n\nThe crystal shimmers, and Savathûn's gentle laughter ripples through Mara's mind. \"I know,\" the Witch Queen murmurs.\n\n\"I could have you jettisoned into the sun,\" Mara says coolly, \"but unlike some creatures, I uphold my word when I give it.\"\n\n\"But we're the same creature, are we not?\" Savathûn wonders. Although Mara can't see her smile, she has no difficulty imagining what it looks like.\n\n\"I am nothing like you.\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\" Savathûn's voice is easy and languid. Some might mistake her for being sincere; Mara has taken the same tone too many times in her own life not to recognize it for what it is.\n\n\"I thought you were a powerful, competent woman plagued by a difficult relationship with her family,\" Savathûn says. \"Someone who weaves complicated, long-spun schemes across the arc of time's bow. My mistake.\"\n\nMara stares at the crystal, clenches her jaw, and turns her back to leave. But before she can take even one step toward the door, she feels Savathûn's consciousness brush like silk against hers.\n\n\"I thought you were someone who believes herself to be so smart,\" Savathûn purrs, \"that she is easily blinded by her own ambitions and self-appointed genius. Someone who is so certain of her solutions that she fails to see the inherent peril in her plans, and yet too embarrassed to ever admit she may have gone astray.\"\n\nTension knots the muscles in Mara's shoulders and back. Over the years, she has trained her face to remain a mask, but she is not always as skilled when it comes to the rest of her body.\n\nSavathûn continues. \"I thought you were someone so afraid of being vulnerable, that you'd rather fail than—\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Mara rounds on Savathûn's prison with the precision of an angry viper. She does not raise her voice; instead, she lowers it. \"That might work on him,\" she says, the last word like fire on her lips because it still pains her to refer to Crow by any name, \"but you'll find my armor has fewer gaps.\"\n\nPower surges around her hands as she slams them against the crystalline surface. A lattice of radiant energy winds itself around Savathûn's prison, and Mara hopes that the furious drumming of her heart and intermittent flare of her nostrils will be mistaken for exertion—not a different kind of weakness.\n\nWhen the spell is complete, Mara steps back. Her glowing eyes dim. She wavers with fatigue, listening for the psychic echo of Savathûn's voice inside her skull.\n\nThere is only silence.\n\n\"Shut up,\" Mara breathes—a strange marriage of relief and loathing.\n\n\"Shut up.\""

Etcetera.\" \n\n\"So, yes. It is interesting that so many cultures have stories of the 'Headless Ones,' but that doesn't prove they exist. If anything, it suggests that simultaneous invention is much more universal than previously thought,\" Matsuo concluded."

Regarding the power known as Deepsight and its use within VIP #7282's throne world:\nSome Guardians have already used this power to access secret pockets of space. Hidden agents have dubbed them \"Altars of Reflection\" for now. There, the invocation of Deepsight in concert with significant objects has enabled us to view memories belonging to #7282.\n\n2. Access to this power requires spending time with the Relic, and subsequently, in one of the Pyramids. Long-term exposure to Darkness in this manner carries inherent risk, and the process is nontrivial. However, in the interest of learning everything possible about this space and the relevant VIP, certain chances must be taken.   \n\nConsidering the sensitive nature of the topic, reports should be directed subject to the attention of IKO-006 only. \n\n3. So far, it is estimated that Guardians have been able to view memories that #7282 wants. This supposition is upheld by #7282's specific and personal input on the memories in question. But why these memories? This remains a worthwhile question to answer in order to understand #7282's larger goal.\n\n4. Hidden agent (LIN-357) was dispatched in full understanding of requisite risks to determine the following as possible: limits and potential of physical space, applicability of other items and memories, span of #7282's attention to the mentioned spaces, possibility for use of Deepsight outside of Altar parameters, and possibility for use of Altar parameters with other applications.  \n\n5. LIN-357 is also to assess potential danger in continuing and encouraging Guardian access to and use of Altar spaces. \n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

I arrived onsite and made my way into the Altar space. It doesn't appear to have changed much, if at all, from earlier provided telemetry. As predicted, there were barriers to access: several of the Lucent Brood obstructed my passage and were subsequently dispatched without much trouble. Additionally, the same complication as previously reported blocked the way—Hive runes. Parsing their nature and repetition of specific patterns was required to gain full access to the Altar. \n\n2. On the topic of the presented resistance: there were significantly fewer Hive defenders than could have been mustered, given intelligence on available forces. Based on the token nature of this resistance and the fact that VIP #7282 surely knows that Guardians have been here, it can be assumed that the defense is not a sincere attempt to keep us out. Historical precedent exists for setting a guard on a location or item to make it appear more attractive. \n\nPrecedent also exists for opening the way for Guardians to participate in the Hive sword logic. I do not yet have reason to believe this is taking place here, especially given the severance of #7282's connection to the Worm Gods that have otherwise led her species, but it does not pay to be incautious around the Hive.\n\n3. Once appropriate precautions were taken against any further incursions, I deployed sensors to record what data is possible, focusing on the central Altar and its exterior boundaries. Simultaneously, it was necessary to assess the available space for myself; impressions follow.\n\nIt is more aesthetically appealing than we usually associate with Hive—only the structures bear vague resemblance to those on Luna. The colors are pleasing, far removed from scarlet and rot, and the area lacks jagged edges or significant quantities of bone. Structurally, it is a space clearly built to highlight the central area, and indeed, it draws one to the Altar itself.\n\nAll told, in architecture alone, the creator demonstrates a clear evolution, presumably mirroring her own.\n\n4. On the topic of the structure: although the available space does not appear to have walls, there is a definite boundary. Matter grows foggy, and there is a strong sense of pushback when moving away from the center. Initially, I believed this to be a function of the architecture, but significant willpower was required to force myself to look further into testing the concept. That alone suggests it should be investigated more. \n\nConscious of the bias in doing so, I am marking it for later experimentation, as it would involve straying from the central objective. Further data forthcoming.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

With the perimeter secured and all sensors ready for analysis, there is no immediate further obstacle to the initial experiments with Deepsight. On Vanguard authorization, I've borrowed one of the existing artifacts that has been used to produce and view VIP #7282's memories. Item: a shard of the crystal that #7282 used recently as a protective measure, cf. REP # 197-HIVE-SAV. \n\n2. In summary, following the known and established process, there is no deviation from what was previously reported. The memory of #7282's death and subsequent acquisition of Light played back as expected, identical in every beat. (See attached file for additional details as necessary.) This is not unexpected, and the recording, etc., have been made largely for archival purposes.\n\n3. Subsequent repetitions of the same process revealed additional words from #7282. Perhaps foolishly, I replied to portions of her dialogue that seemed to request a response. However, there was no explicit answer—I believe it is safe to conclude that there is no awareness of hers here, and what is heard is likely a recording coded to this specific memory and/or object. Her use of this method to influence and sow doubt is not unexpected.\n\n4. As a test, I used the crystal item to invoke Deepsight in the same fashion I used previously, this time with the intent of viewing something different—there are plentiful records of #7282's interactions with Vanguard and Reef personnel around the larger crystal this piece was retrieved from. However, none of these were viewable. The same item only allowed viewing of the same memory, suggesting a permanent association. I have some additional analysis planned to confirm this. \n\nAt first glance, these observations imply that if we wish to discover further memories, we will need to collect additional items, likely of personal relevance to #7282. (Confirmation of required item nature forthcoming.)\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

Logical next steps in analysis involve changing a variable in the known functional equation. I've taken the liberty of borrowing some items from others in order to conduct some tests regarding expectations—it is worth assessing how much influence the viewer has on the outcome.\n\n2. First test—Introduction of reasonably generic items. As expected, a chunk of Glimmer did nothing. A broken-off piece from the grip of a new sidearm, purchased specifically for this purpose—next to nothing. For a moment, there was a shadow, something that vaguely resembled the gunsmith at work or in conversation, but no memory replay as seen in the items known to produce memories of VIP #7282.\n\n3. Second test—I had an acquaintance borrow a trinket from a friend of theirs whom I have not met. The item is a medallion smaller than my palm, with old, rubbed-faint engravings. Following the introduction of this item to the Altar, a visible memory resulted, playing out in third person much like the other memories. I recorded details of this memory for reference and confirmation of accuracy. (Specifics omitted here as irrelevant.)\n\nOnce a recording had been made and committed, I accessed the file provided by the owner of the item. This file included summaries of what he thought were the most likely memories to be associated with the item. As you can see, details of what I observed matched one of those summaries. Owner's Ghost to provide additional context if necessary, either on my return or when another Hidden agent reaches out.\n\nWould like to recommend that another agent repeats the same test to see if they can view something different.\n\n4. While we had no reason to doubt the previously revealed memories, all this adds an additional layer of certainty: that which we can ascertain via the Altars is the truth, full and clear. The only remaining doubts are regarding why, and which memories. VIP #7282 is known to be cunning but has ultimately been truthful in previous dealings with the Vanguard. Regrettably, these things are not mutually exclusive. \n\n5. I had additional plans for analysis of the Altars involving personal items and memory, but I am reconsidering the wisdom in doing so, as well as the necessity. Beyond confirming that the memories produced are repeatable, true, and personal, do we need to know more? I will be moving on to the substance of the world next. \n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

I moved forward with invocation of a personal item anyway, despite previous report concluding that it was unnecessary. Testing continued with the cloak I have kept from back then, the one I was wearing when I was found. I don't know what I was expecting from it—just that after all that time not remembering, my curiosity won out. I wanted to know.\n\n2. The memory was… like a key in a lock, all the rest laid open to me once I remembered this one thing.\n\nThe first time I witnessed the memory, I barely processed any of what was happening; I was so caught up in simply looking at her. I forgot to breathe. She had the most luminous blue eyes… how could I have ever forgotten her?\n\nEverything in my head was jumbled, all the things I'd forgotten were trying to be heard at once, and she was the only constant. So I used the item again, this time intending to make a coherent report, thinking I could process by writing it all down. I just wound up watching again, caught up in remembering the three of us.

I'd wondered what might be in that gap, and why I hesitated even when I was curious. It wasn't enough to know that I had survived and should not return. I think, despite all that wondering, some part of me didn't want to remember. \n\nBut that's how lies happen, isn't it? In the places we don't want to look.

I'm not going anywhere in particular. Just… out. Away. Crystal and runes and the impression of beauty grow fuzzy and frail around me, and the steps to take grow harder, as if dragging my body through mud instead of walking on solid ground. Fog blinds me, and now I hear it: whispering, barely distinguishable, but louder as I go. \n\nI know what my body failing feels like, and I don't care.

But with the loss of Sagira, the time I have left in a Human lifespan is infinitesimal; less than a mote in the vast sands of time. All I have of value—my insights, my discoveries, my reputation—they are all rooted in my past, and I do not have the time left to accomplish more.

Which is why I have made my deal with the devil.\n\nI have willingly submitted to Savathûn and allowed her to take my place among the Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard have  fought like trapped animals for too long. They hoard secrets; every fact they learn gets crammed into the barrel of a gun and fired at the heart of our newest target. We are losing this war despite individual, pyrrhic victories, and what pitiful harm Savathûn can inflict with our limited resources pales against the value of this opportunity. The Witch Queen sits on a throne of secrets accreted over a billion years. While she huddles in the crumbling ruin of our city, I am left alone in her storied halls to learn all she has seen. \n\nZavala and Ikora are dear friends and noble souls, but they are adventurers.

No ground below him. Falling—no, floating. Pine needles sway in a sea of surrounding green haze. Sunrays plunge through the canopy above and wash over him. His head is lost in the arbor row's motion.\n\nIntermittent feeling prickles the skin beneath his tarnished armor. Saladin reflexively attempts to raise his off-hand to summon Isirah. Numbness responds. He must be hit. He cycles breath through his lungs and sorts instinct from reason. He twists to see the wound. Nerves blaze corkscrews through his neck. Panic—no. No need. Pain he could abide. Reality clarifies. \n\nThe Iron Lord hangs from a branch run through his shoulder back to front, 10 centimeters thick. What good was his damn armor? Saladin traces a thick flow of blood down his arm as it breaks into tributaries before reuniting at his fingertips. Droplets pool some 60 meters below, soon to soak into the soil and fade. Beside the pool lay a splintered rocket launcher he'd forged from a reclaimed mortar, dropped when he lost consciousness. Saladin flexes against the axe strapped to his backplate; wood grinds against his load-bearing collarbone. He grimaces as he lifts his head to gaze at the cliff above.\n\nSmoke rises from a burnt crescent impact, blown clean into the cliff's edge; a recent scar left by an artillery shell meant for Saladin's road-cruiser. Raiders, he thinks. An ambush. He connects incident to meaning: someone looking to make an example of a Lord who dared to venture beyond their territory. Radegast had warned him of Risen thugs fleeing to the far wilds to escape the Iron Lords' reach. He had told Saladin of their hostility. Their lawlessness. Saladin would tame it.\n\nBinocular reflection catches his sight over the smoldering cliff, looking down in his direction. Unfamiliar voices echo across the rocks. A figure calls out, and others join them. Between hacking coughs, Saladin counts half a dozen hostiles. His fingers ache with chill, and his lungs sting as if coated in rime. He exhales unsteadily. For a moment, Saladin imagines Lady Jolder plunging through the clouds, booming with laughter. He imagines her obliterating the cliffside with a colossal javelin of Arc lightning without hesitation. These nameless men die, and she keeps laughing until Saladin joins. His near miss becomes an embarrassing story embellished round a campfire until another takes its place, and it is forgotten. Lucidity falters, and in this moment, he can almost breathe the ash. Smell the stormy night air. Feel the warmth of the fire, of his friends. As real as worn memories, rosed with age.\n\nLight condenses into Saladin's fingers. Arc lines fork across the bark as he grips the branch impaled through his shoulder. It hooks upward from his chest; better to break it, he thinks. Fingers dig and scorch pulp. They bite in and twist. Wood pops and splinters as a bullet snaps through the pine canopy behind him. Then another, closer this time as the sound of rifle fire echoes down the cliff face. Saladin focuses his Light into the edge of his palm and slashes the splintered branch free, leaving him dangling on a stub of wood. He takes a shaky breath and swings a tingling leg back to push off the trunk behind him, bracing his boot to support his weight against the wood and lift his bone clear from the branch. His armor is slick with blood now, and he can feel a fracture in his bone. Pain he can abide. He recites it as mantra. The dive to the ground below would be dangerous. Saladin prepares to push off and jump.\n\nA round strikes his armored torso, knocking the air from his lungs. His foot slips and kicks out violently. His weight shifts on the broken branch, catching hard on his collar and sending fissures through his fractured bone. Saladin roars over the gunfire and grips his shoulder.\n\n\"Isirah! Get. Me. Off. This. Branch,\" he snarls.\n\nHis Ghost materializes before him. \"I taught you better than to rely on me,\" Isirah reproves him. She swoops behind Saladin for cover. \"You're not dead yet. You're capable of this.\" \n\nSaladin strains to regain his footing. He lifts his head and wheezes as his lungs expand. Several figures above congregate around a large object, a blur of metal he recognizes as a flak cannon.\n\n\"I yield,\" Saladin laughs weakly. \n\n\"What would you do if I weren't here, Forge? If I'd been killed?\" His Ghost taps the back of his head with a pellet of Light. \"It's just you and your Light. What little you have left.\"\n\nHim and his Light against a weapon of war. But they were just men, and he: a fiend of fire. \n\nSaladin conjures waning star-fire from his bones: the last vestiges of his will, burnt as offering to the Light. Flame billows and radiates through his flesh, swirling between the gaps in his armor, moving to consume the branch. Sap hemorrhages in hissing bubbles from the wood around him. Flames overtake the branch, joining those building from the Iron Lord's armor. Ash wisps upward on agitated, anabatic wind. With a pop, he descends into freefall.\n\nBranches snap against his legs as he picks up speed. Saladin gropes for the axe on his back with his good hand. As fingers find hilt, and Solar Light engulfs the weapon. He swings the axe from its strap and sinks the flaming blade into the tree, slowing his descent and carving a wake of sparking embers toward the forest floor. The pull threatens to rend him apart. He holds until he can hold no longer and plummets the final 10 meters: wreckage striking bedrock with a wet thud.\n\nBlood-vapor steams from the charred forest floor around him as he comes to. Overhead, the forest canopy explodes with a flak shell detonation. Fragmentation whistles through the air, showering the forest with ragged chunks of metal. Saladin kicks off the trunk at his feet and rolls his ravaged body onto his rocket launcher. Muscle threatens to separate as he hoists the launcher to his shoulder. Saladin howls, a wounded beast's final challenge. He presses the split launcher shut with his forearm and welds the metal with Solar heat before fumbling to find the trigger. Another shell booms; dense pine canopy opens momentarily from the blast wave. Saladin sees a clean line to the ridge, takes aim, and squeezes. He watches the rocket fly as shards of flak-iron carve lines through his face."

        "text": "Burning grass fills Saladin's nostrils like smelling salts. He stirs from the abyss into a new life, back pressed against a towering pine that smolders with heat. Saladin blinks blurriness from his eyes to see the crater on the cliff where his rocket struck. Good, he thinks, picking fragments of metal from his plate. Isirah sinks through the smoke just overhead and levitates in front of his face, Light still coursing through her frame.\n\n\"Welcome back. You lost,\" Isirah says, her voice smooth as verglas.\n\n\"It was a draw.\" Saladin stands and fumbles with a talisman hanging from his neck. He tucks the stamped iron insignia into the gorget of his armor. \"They're dead, aren't they?\"\n\n\"There are a million raiders and one of you,\" Isirah snaps. She drifts into his eyeline. \"A draw is a loss. We need to do better than that.\"\n\n\"We?\" Saladin narrows his eyes and yanks his stuck axe from the scorched trunk and slings it.\n\n\"Fix what you break.\" Isirah had imparted this lesson many times. \"You should have opened fire on the road without hesitation. I warned you they were bait.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to rest your laurels on that prediction?\" Saladin groans.\n\nIsirah's shell tightens like a coiling viper. \"Do you have a plan from here?\"\n\n\"Continue sweeping east. The broadcast code might have been Golden Age, but the signal was weak when we caught it. Can't be far, and our patrol can wait until we clear this up.\"\n\n\"Fine observation. I agree,\" the Ghost says curtly, floating off ahead.\n\nSaladin looks to the burning pine and uncuffs his gauntlet. Strands of ruddy leather stick beneath his nails as he removes the glove and presses his hand to bark. This tree had likely stood for centuries, roots deep in the soil, branches carving territory into the greater forest. So it was for many other trees. They all had their space—a crown shyness shared by old things. One born in this forest might assume this tree had always been. \n\nHe feels the warmth radiating from the roasting heartwood above; Light still crackles in the ember-split wood. His Light. Left alone, it would destroy this old pine, consume it from the inside out. Saladin anchors the Light to his core and commands it to return, dousing the burn. The tree will heal, and today's wound will fade. This gouge marks a point of struggle surpassed, and given enough time, will fade into familiarity.\n\n\"Someone is coming,\" Isirah reports in a quiet voice.\n\n\"Are they armed?\" Saladin whispers, hand slowly drifting to the haft of his slung axe.\n\nBefore Isirah can answer, a thin man in coarse linen fumbles into view. Terror paints his face as his eyes fall on Saladin.\n\n\"I—I have no weapon,\" the man says with a thick local accent. He eyes Saladin's equipment. \"You… are Iron Lord?\" Awe washes over the man's face.\n\nIsirah zips between him and Saladin. \"Did you not hear the explosions? What do they teach you people out here?\"\n\n\"Many stray dogs fight here.\" The man's gaze drops to the ground. \"Sometimes scraps are left after. Weapons—\"\n\n\"Like a buzzard,\" Saladin accuses.\n\n\"No!\" The man throws his hands in the air. \"Others steal from village. We find weapons to fight back.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Saladin nods.\n\n\"Do you or your people have a radio?\" Isirah asks.\n\nThe man lets out a curt laugh before realizing the Ghost is serious. \"Oh. Uh, no?\"\n\n\"Then this is a waste of our time,\" Isirah whispers to Saladin.\n\nThe man steps forward. \"Please, wait, find mercy in your heart.\" He braces a hand on his thigh and takes a slow knee. \"Iron Lords protect people. You kill monsters.\" His eyes dart between man and Ghost. \"You want payment?\"\n\nSaladin sighs. \"We're not mercenaries.\"\n\n\"Food, then? Better than what can be foraged here,\" he says, offering a blackened crust of bread from a twine rucksack. \"Cleaned armor and clothes? Blankets, clean water, and… and good company by warm fire.\" The man nods eagerly. \n\nSaladin turns the meager portion of stale bread in his hand. Between winter and latent radiation, reliable food is scarce here, making thievery into a grave offense. He knows the man is lying about their resources, but only out of desperation. The kind that sends you running toward explosions. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Ah! Kepre. I am Kepre.\"\n\n\"You said you were being stolen from, Kepre?\"\n\n\"More than can be replaced. Last thieves came, the village lost Elmi,\" Kepre says, holding back tears. \"We will starve if thieves are not stopped.\"\n\n\"Show me.\"\n\nThe man leads them down a lightly trafficked footpath marked by hand-driven stakes bearing illegibly worn highway signs. Southeast, until the trees thin and the smell of mudded livestock and wheat overtakes the pine. Isirah and Saladin hang several steps behind Kepre on approach to a small and lightly fenced swine enclosure with a pathway bisecting it. Saladin notes the fence itself serves more to stop the three pigs from wandering off than to keep anything out. He quickly surveys a handful of rusty corrugated metal dwellings that wind out from the swine run and encircle a better maintained storage structure and longhouse. Beside the longhouse lies a humble stable for a goat that chews at Saladin's sleeves when he passes by.\n\nThe handful of families living here stand and stare as Saladin sloshes through the muddy entrance, Isirah floating close behind. Kepre heralds the duo as saviors. The words feel coarse in Saladin's ears, but he graciously shakes the people's hands and takes their stories as evidence toward finding their thieves. There's a prideful nature to their expressions, and the meager gifts they offer. The kind that comes from starting with nothing and arriving at something. Saladin couldn't help but smile at their perseverance.\n\n\"They took Elmi from pen,\" Kepre says. \"Scared our goat. My son and I chased them, but they made off with her, along with half the dried meat stores.\" He wrings his hands.\n\n\"Elmi is a pig,\" Saladin says flatly.\n\nKepre nods, teary-eyed. \"Only girl hog. Without her… without her, we starve.\"\n\nIsirah flitters close to Saladin as she emits a wide sweeping scan from her shell. \"Forge, I doubt they're aware, but that Golden Age transmission is receiving a signal from the longhouse.\""

        "title": "III - Plea Deal",
        "text": "Saladin breaks through the tree line on the backslope of a collapsed bluff. Behind him lies the breadth of the old forest, shadow slinking away before the dawn. He and Isirah had trekked two kilometers from Kepre's village to close in on the location of a Golden Age receiver.\n\nAtop the bluff, Saladin turns his attention to a steep sunken basin in front of him, fallen in on itself under the pressure of one of Earth's many invasions. A rusted antenna from a bygone era still penetrates through the rubble in the middle of overgrowth, debris, and ruined transmission dishes. Faded block lettering runs down the length of the antenna which read: POINT PERIHELION. Centered below the antenna, Saladin could make out a tarnished hatch.\n\n\"The signal in the longhouse was a recording device,\" Isirah explains. \"Its transmission was received here.\"\n\n\"So, the thief planted a recon device unbeknownst to the villagers,\" Saladin concludes.\n\n\"Clever way to find openings,\" Isirah says. \"I'm also detecting electric current. There must be a power cell underneath all that rubble. Felwinter Peak could make use of it,\" she notes.\n\n\"Raiders seem unlikely. No violence in the village, no territorial claims… and they stole a pig, of all things,\" Saladin says. \"Sounds more like a starving animal.\" \n\nIsirah hums in consideration. \"Wild animals get put down when they start killing livestock.\"\n\nSaladin chuckles. \"And feral wolves become loyal hounds when shown mercy. Isn't that right, Isirah?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Eventually.\" Isirah sighs. \"You want to protect the people here? Empower the Lords with whatever tech is running down there. Impose order before a Warlord seizes control. Don't chase strays hoping to tame them.\"\n\n\"As luck would have it, we can do both.\" Saladin's mouth curls into a rare smirk.\n\n\"Luck isn't something we should depend on, Forge.\"\n\nOnce at the antenna base, Saladin notes traces of rubbed away rust on the hatch's hinges. He surveys the many gaps and recesses scattered through the field of debris around him, awaiting an ambush from one of them. When none appear, Saladin scoffs, as if offended, and spins the hatch wheel until it thuds loudly and drops open.\n\nSaladin recoils as putrid odor floods his nose. He takes the axe from his back and sets it aflame. Flickering illumination scatters shadows throughout the dark hatchway. The room is of moderate size, mostly buried beneath encroaching nature. It appears to be the remnants of a control tower erected to bridge a communicational divide. Several preserved slogans in long-dead languages line the interior walls, their meanings lost on him.\n\n\"Anyone?\" he asks.\n\n\"Carbon levels suggest a handful of recent inhabitants, some decomposition, but electrical interference is scrambling my readings.\"\n\n\"Old-fashioned way, then,\" Saladin says, slipping into the opening. His feet slam to the floor under the weight of his armor, followed by Isirah. Sudden movement catches his eye. He prepares to swing as a silhouette dashes toward him and squeals.\n\nHe snatches the pig mid-dash. It thrashes in his grasp. \"Elmi,\" Saladin grumbles. Holding the squirming hog, he sweeps the lit axe over the room, stopping to examine a shadowed corner full of stacked garbage. \n\nIsirah homes in on the same spot and ignites her flashlight to reveal a face—a filthy shoulder—and a gun barrel half-buried and hidden among the refuse. \n\n\"Good pig.\" The young girl has him at gunpoint, flatfooted. Saladin's brow furrows as he eyes his opponent: no older than fourteen, a wilder-child girl wrapped in furs and smears of dirt.\n\n\"I will put a hole in you.\" Her unsteady voice grapples with seldom spoken syllables. \"No lie!\" The scrawny girl's dim eyes and matted hair are silvered with persistent trauma.\n\nSaladin steps forward, his massive frame overshadowing the wilder-child girl. \"You're not going to kill me, girl.\" \n\n\"I'll take your demon when you're dead.\" The girl hesitates for a moment before yelling, \"I know it gives magic. Then Jaxxen will be afraid too!\" Experience had clearly deafened her to empathy; morality was a luxury for a civilized age she'd never known.\n\nIsirah bursts out laughing behind Saladin. \"Try.\"\n\nThe girl swings the rifle to Isirah and fires. Saladin drops Elmi—to clattering squeals—and stops the bullet in the air with his hand before it contacts his Ghost. He picks the round from the interior backplate of his gauntlet, blood running from the fresh hole in his palm. \"Whoever you stole these from is underpacking their grains.\"\n\nShe hisses at him and hastily tries to slip another dirty round into the chamber. Saladin rushes the girl. He slaps the rifle from her hands and lifts her aloft by her scruff. She stares directly into his eyes, accepting the deathblow to come. \n\n\"Now that you're listening…\" Saladin places her feet to floor. \"Sit down, child.\"\n\nHer expression is a caked mask of survival fugue, a hare's heart from expiration. He had felt that waking confusion before. Risen into nothing, with nothing.\n\nSaladin knows the penalty for theft is death, but that action was final. He also knows the strength of potential, of justice beyond the letter, of mercy. She needs something of sense to hold against the barrage of madness the world had become.\n\n\"Your name?\" \n\n\"Just kill me.\"\n\n\"I'm not a Warlord, girl.\" Saladin, a banneret, plants his molten axe firmly in the ground, blood from his hand sizzling down the haft. \"I won't show you death. I'll show you a way to live.\"\n\nStill, her eyes do not leave the burning axe for some time. She refuses rations as no one had ever given her something without the intent to extract far more in return.\n\n\"Last time. Name?\"\n\n\"Fera.\"\n\n\"If you were hungry, I'm sure that village would have taken you in. Winter's soon, and stealing… What if you'd driven that village to starvation?\"\n\nThe girl stares through him vacantly. \"Jaxxen said bring gifts; promised to give my brother back.\"\n\nIsirah patches Saladin's hand with Light. \"And did he?\" she asks.\n\nFera's vapid expression falters. Saladin eyes the refuse pile behind her under Isirah's light. A wrapped child's body is buried within the mound. \n\nHe places a gentle hand on the girl's shoulder. \"Take me to Jaxxen.\"\n\nThe hike to the Warlord's commune is several days north. Over the journey, Saladin teaches the girl to trap rabbits and hunt game. Where she sees a predator inflicting their will, Saladin explains the mercy of delivering a quick death. He tells her the wolf does not hunt for themselves, but for the pack. Alone, they are mongrels, driven by instinct and hunger. That violence spreads. It is the promise of the pack that keeps them true. It is the order that binds us together.\n\nThey make camp on the outskirts of Jaxxen's hold. Saladin rolls stringy meat between his glowing palms, and the smell of cooking hare fills his nostrils. It is a catch from Fera's first sturdy trap, a bounty they share in peace.\n\n\"You see? Together, we can provide for each other.\" Saladin hands Fera a cooked leg. \"This is how we go from simply surviving, to living. Community, order, laws. That is how we move forward.\"\n\n\"What are laws?\" Fera asks, mouth full of rabbit.\n\n\"They're rules. Promises of how to treat each other.\"\n\n \"Promises break…\" she says, swallowing.\n\n\"People like me make sure they're kept. People like you could too.\" Saladin sees her confusion and continues, \"Sometimes when a Lord can't remain to protect an area, we appoint a vassal in our stead.\"\n\nFera looks at him quizzically.\n\n\"Someone to watch over the woods while I'm gone. Someone like you who understands why promises should be kept.\" Saladin unclasps a chain from his neck. \"This makes you one of our pack, Fera. A wolf. And we protect our own.\"\n\n\"How?\" she asks, grasping the talisman tightly as Saladin hangs it around her fragile neck.\n\n\"Like you, there will be others who need a place. Find them. Bring them back to the village you stole from. Promise to protect each other. That is how.\"\n\nIn the morning, Fera takes Saladin to the edge of Jaxxen's encampment where the woods give way to craggy rock and dry dirt. The Iron Lord tells her to await his return at their campsite. He strides into Jaxxen's camp as alarm yells raise defenders. Fera steps back into the tree line, but she does not leave.\n\n**\n\nFera watches the Iron Lord tear through body after body with brutal efficiency—a savage, blood-drunk beast. The young girl devours every violent image of its axe spilling sizzling crimson. She delights in the beast's hollow reception to their screams for mercy. Her wide eyes fill with lightning, flame, and gore. It is a painting of cathartic balance. Though she does not know the words, it is a vengeful righteousness that takes hold in her. The beast is Jaxxen's punishment for misdeeds: promised order imposed through dominance.\n\nFera rubs her talisman when the Warlord Jaxxen emerges, amethyst-Light surrounding him. A moment of fear creeps into her heart as Jaxxen bellows laughter and charges. But he too falls under an obliterating column of lightning called down by the beast's thunderous roar. All that remains is the crackle of his cindered bones flaking into ash.\n\nShe smiles.\n\n**\n\nSaladin stands at the edge of Jaxxen's burning encampment. He looks to the lightning-scorched earth where Jaxxen had stood and summons Isirah.\n\nIsirah surveys the aftermath. \"Good. But you're going to let the girl go? Stealing food and attacking an Iron Lord are death offenses, and you want to do nothing?\" Isirah's doubt is palpable. Saladin knows she's seen how wild things age. \"You're procrastinating,\" she fumes.\n\n\"Fera's young enough to find a different future.\" Saladin meets Isirah's gaze. \"Just like I did.\"\n\nIsirah whirs with exasperation. \"The world is full of wayward orphans, Forge. Your job is to enforce Iron laws, not interpret gray areas.\"\n\n\"I am an Iron Lord, and our laws are mine to interpret as I see fit,\" Saladin snaps. \"We'll salvage the battery and bring her back to Kepre with the pig. Then we're leaving.\" His voice is stern and unyielding. \"That's the end of it.\""

        "title": "IV - Few Words Between Them",
        "text": "Winter wind sweeps over the forest of pine; fresh snowfall smattering tops the canopy. Isirah mentions the pines are much taller than when Saladin had last seen them, but he cannot imagine their aging. He only sees what is there now. If he could have stood beneath their needles and watched their 50 years of growth, would he notice the difference?\n\nThe spot where he had burned the Warlord's hold is covered in new growth and snow. He draws a mental line from it to the bluff where he'd met Fera all those years ago, then to Kepre's village. Blurry smoke ascends through woods and snow flurry—a cooking fire, maybe. Bacon, he hoped. Saladin leans over the ridge where he had fallen before and steps over the edge.\n\nUnder thin slush, Saladin and Isirah find the once well-trodden path toward Kepre's village. No one meets them on the road—though Isirah catches several signs of sudden movement on her scanners. \"Animals,\" Saladin suggests. Looking through the breaks in the branches, he notices a thickening black smoke against the snowfall.\n\nA ghostly mist winds through the thinning pines as the duo reach Kepre's village. Smells of singed hair and burnt pork invade the winter air. Iron Lord and Ghost exchange looks before she decompiles. Saladin rushes into the clearing, Fool's Remedy in hand and snow crunching under his heavy boots. He follows glistening blood lines soaked into the soot and snow, through empty pens devoid of hay, past hollow wooden skeletons of rotted homes, until they meet at the rusted frame of a desiccated longhouse. Through snowblind and moth-ridden tatters, he sees them.\n\nGraves. Lines of them. Then piles of stone. Bare mounds of shallow churned earth follow. Smoke rises behind them over a dug-out depression. Saladin fixates on the number of them. The groupings. He counts them as he walks, until he reaches the edge of the smoking pit, and the numbers lose all meaning. A huddled, smoking mass of carnage lay tangled in the pit before him. Cauterized panic. Still smoldering in the frigid air.\n\nSaladin stares into the sunken sockets of a charred face. He imagines Kepre's face staring back at him. Was it him? Features all burned away. Years older. Saladin turns to see Isirah studying something in the longhouse. Through flames rising in his eyes he sees a crude reproduction of an Iron sigil nestled in a wolf's blackened skull.\n\n**\n\nThe Golden Age antenna no longer received signals. It was bent, unable to discern anything for itself, but still able to throw noise into the sky. A new settlement had formed around it, fenced with wooden spears, and built along the basin in a spiral shape. Saladin makes his way inside the oddly vacant encampment unharried, and descends. Where once a hatch had led him down into a center of communication, now a hollow building lay carved open. A path of set stones had been pressed into the ground over years of foot traffic; crimson moss takes root in the mud that fill in the gaps. It flows underground to an open hall, like an estuary. He tells Isirah to stay outside, to watch his back.\n\nSilvered eyes pierce through the dim hall fashioned from the surrounding comms station. Saladin watches the moonlight gleaming off them like two dancing spirits. He sees himself in that fearless stare.\n\n\"I didn't imagine I'd see you here again, young one.\"\n\n\"It's been a long time since anyone called me young.\" Fera, Packmaster, sits upon a scrapheap of a throne at the rear of the hall, eight rugged gunners flanking her. She's a woman now, several decades of age and violence etched into her sun-scarred skin and wizened face. Her finger taps a half-missing ear, long healed. \"You came from far away. What for?\"\n\n\"Rumors of rabid wolves prowling the outlands.\" Saladin looks to the men flanking Fera. \"Are these yours?\"\n\nFera leers at the crest on Saladin's armor. \"My pack. Most are hunting now.\"\n\n\"I removed the Warlord, and you took his place.\" Saladin voice is thick with rage.\n\n\"Same as it ever was,\" Fera muses. \"Someone had to keep order in your absence.\"\n\nSaladin scans the room with disgust. \"This is not what I taught you.\"\n\nFera smiles and looks to her comrades. \"Isn't it? They're orphans of the forest, like me.\"\n\n\"You lost yourself!\" Saladin barks as he steps forward, his finger slipping inside the trigger guard of his holstered weapon.\n\nFera cackles breathily. \"Because I followed you. I asked forgiveness for stealing, and they took my ear… So next time I met them, I took back. It continued, until they lost everything.\" She gestures behind her to her grinning disciples and stashes of stolen goods. \"The pack decides what is best.\"\n\n\"Iron Lords don't slaughter innocent villages. We don't starve people. I don't murder children,\" Saladin growls, heat building under his skin.\n\n \"What do you do when a Warlord refuses to bow? Order is imposed, old, gray Lord. Or have you forgotten your lessons?\" She shifts in her seat. \"I learned that when you slapped the rifle out of my hand. When you leveled Jaxxen's camp. I understood.\"\n\n\"I made a mistake thinking what you needed was mercy.\" Saladin exhales.\n\nThe Iron Lord swiftly unholsters Fool's Remedy. A quick burst drops Fera's right-most wolf, leaving the pack stunned. Saladin steps forward and kicks Fera's throne, sending her and the chair skipping across the ground like a pond-stone, until it crashes and pins her to the far wall.\n\nFera's left-most wolf draws a wicked machete and lunges. Saladin whips the axe from his back with his off-hand and cleaves the bandit clean pelvis to crown. The two halves slump limply to the floor. Horror freezes the pack as blood pools around them. Fera's shrill voice screams, \"Put him down!\"\n\nBullets cross in the air as muzzle flashes erupt in every direction. Saladin pivots to face the bulk of the pack, rattling off rounds as freely as his armor and body are receiving them. He kills two. There is no cover. There is no retreat. This is a reckoning.\n\nWolves whine and die around him. A shotgun blast catches his shoulder, drawing blood and disarming his pistol. He staggers back under the debt of his wounds. Red drips from beneath his epaulet, but pain is the furthest thing from his mind. He ignites the arm in fiery Light and casts a Solar hammer that caves in the shotgunner's skull with a sizzling pop.\n\nThe second to last wolf drops an empty weapon and tries to run. Saladin heaves his axe across the hall and catches the coward in the back. They collapse under the heft of the molten blade and combust. He turns to the last wolf frantically trying to reload their weapon. They back into a corner as they rack their rifle and spray rounds. Saladin charges through the gunfire and slams them against the wall. He unleashes a barrage of Arc-wreathed fists that pulverize his foe into convulsing pulp.\n\nSaladin sees Fera, still pinned and struggling beneath the throne. Burning wreckage around her.\n\nHe grimaces as he flips the throne off her, wraps hands around her neck, and lifts her aloft. His fingers crush the air from her throat until they feel spine. His body aches. He pauses to catch his breath. To see remorse in her eyes. \n\nFera places a gentle hand on his fingers. \"How long until one comes to repay your violence?\" she wheezes.\n\nTheir eyes meet. Saladin's grip loosens.\n\nWith her other hand, Fera plunges a narrow blade into Saladin's neckline. He winces and turns to see the thin sliver of metal in her hand. Saladin meets her eyes again. There is no fear. His grip tightens until bone shatters. He releases and lets her body crumple where it lands. He watches the life slip from her eyes, replaced by pain, trembling near death. \n\nSaladin picks up his sidearm and delivers her one final mercy.\n\nIsirah floats near the settlement's fence, a small shadow against early morning sun piercing through snow flurries. Saladin climbs the distance to her before she heals his wounds. The journey is a purifying penance, he tells himself. \n\nPain he can abide."

        "text": "Caiatl's feet stubbornly refused to touch the floor.\n\nShe—at least, the loose approximation of her body—floated inelegantly in the Psion's Mindscape. She reached out for purchase as a bit of geometry drifted by, but her hands were as intangible as smoke.\n\nShe growled. \"Can you increase the… clarity?\" she spoke aloud.\n\nAn indignant chirp filled her mind, a flutter of yellow, the tensile sensation of bending green wood.\n\n\"Then try harder,\" she said, not without affection.\n\nThe floor of the Mindscape buckled and then rose to meet her. There was no sensation as she stood upright. She took a step. The space swirled around her; dense, gaseous, like walking inside a headache.\n\nShe peered into the gray, unimpressed. Her tour of the arena where the Guardians and Lucent Hive would fight was proving disappointing. \"Is this all there is?\"\n\nThe Psion sent her a telepathic explanation: hosting Lightless beings in a Psion's Mindscape was like holding up a hazy mirror, reflecting what was held inside. It would be different, more tangible, for the Lucent Hive. For the Guardians.\n\n\"For those with the Light,\" she sighed, and as she did, a yellow glow lit the mist around her.\n\nShe turned. Far above her manifested the immense visage of Dominus Ghaul. Dirty white storm clouds swirled to form the peaks of his armor. He burned with Light from within, triumphant even in defeat.\n\nShe shook her head. A Guardian with the Synaptic Spear would be able to destroy this aspect, but she was Lightless and could never share the Mindscape with another. She looked up at Ghaul's beatific face with rising anger, ashamed that her image of him was so magnificent.\n\nThe Psion sent her a sharp warning in response: regret, guilt, danger.\n\nShe understood: you face what you bring with you.\n\nGhaul's image parted, revealing Torobatl shining proudly in the night sky.\n\nCaiatl tried desperately to change her focus. She willed into being Ignovun and his ridiculous tusked helmet, Commander Zavala and his cohorts, the holders of the blood treaty, but they were faint and small against the open sky. She searched herself for strength, but Umun'arath's form rose unbidden before her, blood pouring from her wounds, howling in victory.\n\nCaiatl drew back.\n\nTorobatl withered in the sky, its greens and blues fouling to reds and blacks. Caiatl choked on the stench of corpses piled on fields of ash, seas clotted with rot. Dark smoke poured from her dead world and framed the screaming face of Xivu Arath.\n\nAnd something loomed from behind it—something she knew. \n\nXivu Arath towered in the sky, but now her father's corpulence spread to contain all she could see. His finery was tarnished; his purple silks dripped with rank saliva, his gold armor caked with pus. His form swelled grotesquely as it surged toward her. His wet mouth opened, lips slick with sweet fat. His bulging eyes stared wildly at nothing. \n\nShe saw the floor of the Mindscape rise and transform into a barrier; the Psion was attempting to block Calus out.\n\n\"No,\" she commanded, her voice tight. The barrier dissipated.\n\nShe walked closer, moving to meet Calus's figure. The floor reformed tentatively beneath her feet.\n\nCalus bellowed, and for a moment, she was a flea on her father's enormous body. She moved through his cloudy form, within his flesh, the air thick with the rancid stink of wine and blood and vomit. \n\nShe fought her way inward, through the billowing foulness of him, pushing deeper against the gagging smother of his heat. Her form began to lose definition. It threatened to be absorbed by the fetid system around her, and still she fought, and still she fought—\n\nUntil she reached the center, where a form stood at peace in brilliant clarity: her tusks studded with gems, her armor glorious, her eyes clear, her muscles strong.\n\n\"There you are,\" Caiatl whispered, and smiled at herself."

        "text": "\"You brought your own cup?\"\n\nDevrim smiled awkwardly after asking the question. A tea set balanced delicately beside him on the split log he used as a seat. From the other side of the campfire, Saint-14 looked comically oversized as he cradled a blue-and-white ceramic teacup in one large hand. His helmet was off, set in the dirt beside his feet. A slow smile crept across Saint's mouth as he looked at the cup.\n\n\"Not that I mind,\" Devrim continued and motioned with his own teacup. \"It's just—normally, people don't come this prepared for afternoon tea. Although, yours looks like it's, ah, seen a few fights.\" Though Devrim chuckled, his assessment was accurate. Saint's teacup was chipped around the brim; the handle had been broken off at one point and crudely glued back into place.\n\nSaint laughed to himself. \"It is a memento,\" he said. \"The cup is nothing special, just ceramic and paint. But it is the damage that makes it important.\" He finished his tea and offered the cup out to Devrim, who carefully took it to inspect.\n\n\"I forget where I got it. Sat on a shelf in my home long before Osiris and I lived together, before he was exiled. One day, he barges into my home looking for an argument…\" Saint said, watching Devrim. \"Osiris, he gets very heated when he is angry; arms like this!\" Saint waved his arms around in pantomime. \"Very animated.\"\n\nDevrim laughed as he handed Saint's teacup back. \"That sounds about right.\"\n\n\"We argue. Very loud. He accidentally knocks my teacup off shelf, breaks it,\" Saint said, lowering his voice. \"The argument stops. We both feel bad. Osiris apologizes, I apologize. Then…\" Saint stared into the fire. \"Then, he touches my cheek. His eyes say things that words cannot. He leaves. I sweep up the shards and…\"\n\nSaint's voice trailed off into nothingness. The amusement left Devrim's eyes as he looked down into the rippling surface of his tea. \"How is he?\" It was the question Devrim had been too afraid to ask. Saint's shoulders slouched in response, and that was almost all the reply Devrim needed.\n\n\"Not good,\" Saint quietly confessed. \"He is alive. But… his body is there, his mind is not. It is like he is on a journey and cannot find his way home. Or…\" Saint shook his head. He honestly wasn't sure. No one was.\n\nDevrim set his teacup down on the log. He rose and crossed the distance to Saint and then laid a hand on the Titan's shoulder. Devrim looked into Saint's vibrant, mechanical eyes with sympathy. \"Marc and I are having Suraya over for dinner tonight,\" he said with a small, hesitant smile. \"I know it's short notice, but you should come.\"\n\n\"I…\" Saint looked away. \"I shouldn't. I should be with Osiris in case he—\"\n\n\"Osiris has many people waiting by his side tonight. He isn't alone. You shouldn't be either,\" Devrim pressed as he let his hand slip away from Saint's shoulder. \"Dinner. Please.\"\n\nSaint stared down at the chips in his teacup, and fell deeper into the memory of that day. He would give anything to be able to live it over again. To have Osiris by his side, to have something as simple as the touch of a hand on his cheek. But that day isn't today.\n\n\"Okay,\" Saint whispered.\n\nAnd it may not be tomorrow, either."

        "text": "\"Eyes up, New Lights.\"\n\nShaw Han spoke to the group of Guardians assembled at the edge of the Cosmodrome. A field of ancient automobiles spread out behind him.\n\nThe Guardians gathered at uneasy attention, fidgeting in their new armor. Han leapt onto the hood of a rusted-out car so he could be seen over the massive Titans standing in the front.\n\n\"You may have heard they're coming for you,\" Han said. \"That the Hive God of Trickery got her claws on the Light somehow, and now she's sending the toughest baddies humanity has ever faced to drain the life from your carcasses.\"\n\nHan shrugged.\n\n\"You heard right.\"\n\nThe Guardians lifted their weapons and eyed the skies warily. \n\n\"They're coming to the Cosmodrome because the stories they're most frightened of have their beginnings here. They want to wipe out a whole generation of Guardians at its source.\" Han pointed at the Guardians, who were still holding their weapons anxiously. \"They think that they can hit you while you're all still green, before you've got your feet under you. They think you'll go down easy.\"\n\nA haggard crow, cawing harshly, rose from somewhere within the sea of twisted metal. Han smiled and pulled a small canister from his belt, gave it a sharp twist, and tossed it carelessly into the row of cars behind him. \n\nThe Guardians leaned forward in anticipation, but nothing happened.\n\n\"And that's where they're wrong,\" he continued.\n\n\"They have the Light, same as you. They're strong, same as you. But you kicked your way out of your coffins right here in the heart of Old Russia—like so many of the greats before you—and you found yourself in the Vanguard.\"\n\nHan waited for a moment as if tasting the air.\n\n\"And being part of the Vanguard… that means something. The most powerful warriors the world has ever known are here for you. Ikora, Zavala, Saladin, Shaxx, Saint-14… the Guardians who have driven the Hive back into their holes again and again—they're up in the Tower, and they have your back.\"\n\n\"Show them you're willing to fight for the Vanguard, and they'll show you things you wouldn't believe. You'll learn how to weave a shield out of starlight. You'll learn how to wield a blade as hot as the sun—\"  \n\nBehind him, a sudden explosion sent a geyser of dirt and rusted metal high into the air. The startled Guardians huddled together.\n\n\"—and you'll learn the importance of Tripmine Grenades,\" Han finished as he turned. Through the settling dust, he could make out the crumpled remains of a Lucent Hive Knight. \n\n\"One second,\" he said.\n\nHe crept toward the remains, shot his hand into the clearing smoke, and withdrew it with a Hive Ghost squirming in his fist.\n\nThe Ghost's sharp shell dug into Han's palm. Red blood flowed down over its flickering green iris. \n\n\"You're all going to die here!\" it hissed.\n\nHan leapt back onto the hood of the car, still holding the Ghost tightly. \"Ghosts are tough to kill—both ours and theirs,\" he said. \"It takes overwhelming firepower, or a special kind of weapon. Something outside the laws of cause and effect. Something paracausal.\"\n\nHan fixed his gaze on the assembled Guardians and crushed the Ghost in his fist. It burst in a flash of bubbling flame.\n\n\"Something like us,\" Han said. \"Like you.\"\n\nA roar echoed from the distant forest. Dark flames erupted from the tree line as Wizards took to the sky. The ground shook as a clot of bellowing Ogres tore across the field, flinging the remains of ruined cars aside as they charged.\n\n\"You,\" shouted Han over the cacophony, \"each and every one of you are weapons, chosen by the Light. And sure, so are these Hive, and they're every bit as strong as you—when you're alone.\"\n\n\"But being part of the Vanguard?\" Han turned toward the Hive army. His gun began to glow a brilliant gold.\n\n\"That means you're never alone.\"\n\nAnd when the Lucent Hive reached Shaw Han, eager to feast on the New Lights… they met the Vanguard instead."

        "text": "Crow pulled up his hood and watched as the Guardian's ship roared out of the Hangar to race after Caiatl's flagship on the way to the Scarlet Keep.\n\nHe kept to the shadows as he made his way up to the H.E.L.M., pushing through the throngs in the Bazaar with an easy grace, inconspicuous even in his recognizable garb. His light movements belied the twist of guilt in his stomach: Saladin had requested him to handle recon on the mission, yet here he was, creeping instead through the Tower like a common thief.\n\nThere would be consequences, of course, but he could accept that. We all have to make sacrifices, he thought.\n\nHe held his breath as he opened the doors to the Psisorium. As they clicked shut behind him, he threw back his hood and allowed himself a sigh and a smile.\n\nCrow looked up at the Lucent Hive suspended in the holding tanks—not dead, but certainly not alive. The Psion sat in its chair, twitching faintly, its long fingers moving as though tracing through water. Pulses of blue energy radiated out from the Psion's skull and into the depths of the machine.\n\n\"I've got some good news,\" Crow said pleasantly to the Psion as he passed.\n\nThe Psion, as always, said nothing. Crow didn't mind. It probably took all its energy to keep the Hive preserved well enough to skim through their memories. \n\n\"This war is over, thanks to you,\" Crow continued. \"They sent the Guardian, and when the Guardian sets out to do something, it gets done.\"\n\nThe skin on his neck prickled at an old memory. \"Believe me.\"\n\nCrow approached a display interface covered in Cabal runes. He paged through menus until he saw the familiar Vanguard symbol nestled in a corner. He pressed it, and the language on the screen changed. He shook his head in wonder. \"Imagine what we'll be able to make in the future when we're not busy squeezing secrets from the Hive.\"\n\nCrow frowned, looking up at the holding tanks. \"After all this ugliness is behind us,\" he said and resumed scrolling through the menus. \"Now, how do we shut this thing down?\"\n\nHe found his answer in a hidden directory of commands: SECURITY > OVERRIDE > SHUTDOWN > IMMEDIATE. \n\nHe paused for a moment, imagining what Saladin's reaction would be. But he, of all people, should understand. \"After all,\" Crow said quietly to himself, \"the right path isn't always easy to find.\"\n\nCrow executed the command.\n\nHe walked toward the Psion as the lights on the machine began to turn red in sequence. \"Let's get you out of here, friend,\" he said as the Psion began to stir. It blinked slowly and opened its eye. Crow smiled and waved.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said. \"Would you like to go get some ramen?\"\n\nThe pulsing current running through the tubes in the back of the Psion's head slowed, and Crow winced as a white-hot pinpoint of pain stabbed into his mind, shrieking a single word, clear and impossibly loud: \n\nSTOP!\n\nThe machine sputtered. Sparks erupted from the central hub. Cracks spiderwebbed across the holding tanks. Electricity arced from the control panel and Crow staggered backwards.\n\nWithout warning, the energy current in the tubes suddenly reversed. Waves of blue quickly flowed back toward the Psion. He was pulling at the cables connecting him to the chair when the first blast of feedback hit him. His body spasmed with pain. \n\nWave after wave of Psionic energy pounded into the base of the Psion's skull. His muscles stood out in sharp relief as he pulled against the cables, his hands desperate claws, his face stretched with terror.\n\nThe pulses thrummed faster and faster and the Psion began to scream; a high, thin noise. He beat at his own head with one spindly hand, and reached the other out toward Crow.\n\nCrow reached back as another wave of energy hit the Psion, bursting his retina, turning his eye into a muddy black sphere. Crow recoiled in horror, his mind pierced by unimaginable pain, and he fell to the floor in a heap.\n\nThe machine groaned, hissing smoke, the holding tanks boiling, the Hive bodies inside dancing grotesquely in the roiling fluid. The blaring sirens began to overpower the hoarse, sustained screaming.\n\nSomething snapped inside the machine and it shuddered to a stop.\n\nAnd, finally, silence."

        "text": "Saladin hears Caiatl's voice boom over the endless drone of the imperial cruiser's engines. Grains of bloodied sand trickle from the ceiling of the Cabal-sized elevator and fall against his helm as he rides up to the brightly lit arena floor.\n\n\"Guhrn Or'ohk, Valus in the empress's service. You challenge the Iron Lord Saladin Forge, Bracus in the empress's service. You outrank this man.\" Her words circle the spectator stands, sending a hush through the gathered crew.\n\n\"As it should be.\" Or'ohk, his challenger, stands not ten paces in front of him.\n\nCaiatl presses, \"Why challenge him? Did this man slight you?\"\n\nOr'ohk turns to her, kicking up sand. \"He walks our halls, trains our soldiers, and shares our meals as if he is Cabal. That slights. He is not Cabal. I'm not the only one to say so.\"\n\nSaladin looks to Caiatl. He'd attempted to stop this, tried to staunch unnecessary violence with reason, but tradition is not so easily denied.\n\n**EARLIER**\n\n\"This is ridiculous. Killing your officers only weakens us.\" Saladin stepped toward Caiatl. Even seated in her chambers, her eyes were level with his.\n\n\"Funny how our perspectives have shifted since we first met,\" Caiatl grunted.\n\n\"Why are you humoring this?\"\n\n\"Quieting rebellious words does not weaken us. It binds authority in blood.\" Caiatl looked back to myriad datapads on her desk. \"If he submits, no one has to die.\"\n\n\"That seems likely,\" Saladin quipped sarcastically.\n\nCaiatl stood. \"He wants you stripped of your rank and made to clean war beast pens. Indefinitely.\"\n\n\"And that is worth his life?\"\n\n\"I know pride isn't a foreign concept to you… Lord.\" Caiatl spat out his title and walked past him.\n\nSaladin sneered.\n\nThe empress turned to him as she opened her chamber doors, ushering him out. \"What if you lose?\"\n\nHe huffed so hard he almost choked.\n\n**NOW**\n\nCaiatl nods to Saladin. To Or'ohk. They nod back. \n\n\"When the Rite of Proving was conceived, it was to be a level field of battle. We honor that tradition here!\" Caiatl slams a fist down for emphasis before pointing to the arena floor. \"Single combat by blades. One life, no Light. Death… or submission determines the victor.\"\n\nThe crowd erupts in roars as a weapon rack rises from the floor. Or'ohk lifts a heavy cleaver from the rack. Saladin sees his own axe there; he glares at Caiatl for taking it without permission and lifts the axe. \n\nWith weapons drawn, the Rite of Proving begins.\n\nOr'ohk lunges and thrusts the cutting edge of his cleaver toward Saladin's ribs. Saladin sidesteps the massive Cabal blade and bats it down with the haft of his axe. The two test each other's range and speed with a series of back and forth half-committed strikes—until Or'ohk gains favorable footing and bursts forward to swing at Saladin's waist. \n\nSaladin narrowly tumbles over the cleaver. Sparks of contact spit from his leg guards. He lands on his knees and jabs the blunt head of his axe against Or'ohk's exposed throat.\n\n\"This is your one chance to yield,\" Saladin says as the Valus sputters for air and stumbles backward. Or'ohk's cough turns to laughter. He kicks up a cloud of sand and leaps with his cleaver brandished overhead. Saladin wipes granules from his visor and raises his axe to block Or'ohk's heavy swing. The Iron Lord absorbs the shock and controls Or'ohk's blade, sliding it down to catch on his axe-head, and pivoting the weapon's hefty pommel to butt Or'ohk hard in the face. \n\nOr'ohk staggers away and slashes wildly, splitting Saladin's visor and drawing blood. The Iron Lord throws his ruined helm to the ground and wipes blood. He advances, ducking under a deterring swing, parries a second chop away, and severs the Valus's hand.\n\n\"Yield!\" Saladin growls as blood pours onto the sand.\n\nOr'ohk looks to him, to the cleaver still clutched in his detached hand, and back to Saladin. \"Never to you.\" He dives for the cleaver.\n\nSaladin swings, catching Or'ohk's jaw, spewing blood. Or'ohk tenses for a moment, then falls limp.\n\nThe Iron Lord sighs and wrenches his axe free, painted as a warrior in the eyes of the Cabal. \n\nCheers erupt. Caiatl's voice cuts through the frenzied crowd. \n\n\"Rise… Valus Forge!\""

        "text": "Crow drops a wet canteen at Eris Morn's feet. \"Water.\"\n\n\"You made your return quickly.\" Eris crouches, hunched over bundled splits of pine arranged atop a thick log and resin-rubbed moss. She strikes a well-worn flint with her knife, and flame ignites. \n\n\"You're not hard to spot at night.\" Crow averts his gaze from Eris's sideways glare and looks up to the haunting glow of the Dark Shard of the Traveler. Shivers convulse down his vertebrae, and his eyes drop to the freshly popping wood.\n\nEris breaks the silence. \"Why did you volunteer for the severance operation? For… most operations?\"\n\n\"To make a difference where others can't. Same as you.\" \n\nShe shakes her head. \"No,\" Eris mumbles.\n\nCrow watches her deftly coax the fire, considering the answer he'd given. He looks up to the distant tree line and changes the subject. \"There are still a good number of Hive here.\"\n\n\"But no Nightmares,\" Eris remarks.\n\n\"Is that why you brought me here? This… isn't a place I want to revisit.\" Crow steps back from the growing flames.\n\nWhen Eris doesn't respond, he asks his real question:\n\n\"Why did I fail?\"\n\n\"You didn't fail. Our strategy was flawed.\" Eris stands, stowing flint and blade, then steps in front of him to meet his gaze. \"We will attempt the severance again, soon.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Crow replies in a clipped tone. Eris tilts her head, and he can see the green orbs narrow beneath her blindfold.\n\nShe points to the ragged, mountainous shard twisting in twilight roil. \"Even that toxic piece, separate from the Traveler's purity, can be wielded for good.\"\n\nThe fire roars. He kneels to break her stare and warms his hands. \"I know what it can do. I used it—\"\n\n\"When the Red War left Guardians Lightless, there were some who reclaimed their callings here. They re-forged their bond to the Traveler through a scar. A lingering trauma,\" she continues.\n\nEris sits beside Crow and drinks from her canteen. Crow braces for her to continue, but she does not. The bundle of burning kindling collapses into a heap of cinders. Flames spit between the gaps and ash drifts on heated air.\n\n\"I'll get more wood,\" Crow says, hastening to step out of the fire's glow.\n\n\"Crow. Small fires like this kept me alive in the Hellmouth. I did not have the luxury of more wood.\" Eris grips a piece of rusty rebar taken from the Sludge and thrusts it into the sputtering fire. She stirs the cindering wood, opening new gaps and concentrating the larger pieces over a pile of glowing kindling. The flame surges, and heat intensifies. \"During these long nights, we must make use of what is available to us.\"\n\nShe knows he understands her but hasn't accepted the lesson.\n\nShe hands him the bar, shows him how to maintain the fire's heat, how to find worth in remnants. How to rebuild from ash.\n\nThe pair converse as they take turns keeping the fire alive long into the night. The warmth soothes, their shoulders lighten, and Crow pulls back his hood.\n\nWhen the fire finally dies, Eris gestures to the embers. \"Now, you can fetch some wood.\" \n\nCrow smiles and gets to his feet. \"Eris… did you ever try to get your Light back?\"\n\n\"The past is not for dwelling.\"\n\nCrow nods and sticks out his hand. She looks at it inquisitively.\n\n\"Come on.\"\n\nEris stands next to Crow; he clasps her palm and ignites a Golden Gun between their hands. Solar flame dances across Eris's fingers. Crow guides her arm and lifts the gun to the sky. He inhales sharply and howls before cracking a shot through the clouds.\n\n\"You're up, Hunter.\"\n\nEris depresses the trigger, slowly, doubtful that it would fire. A second Solar streak pierces the atmosphere. Crow laughs. They send round after round skyward, howling pent tension into the night until finally, even Eris finds herself smiling."

In the time since the Imperial fleet had formed a blockade around the Leviathan, three separate frigates had defected to Calus's side. A fourth has just followed suit. \n\nCaiatl began this campaign with fire in her heart. Now, she feels only cold and tired.\n\n\"A total of 250 soldiers, Empress,\" Taurun answers.\n\n\"We must strike!\" Ca'aurg shouts suddenly, slamming his fist on the table. \"Anything less will be seen as a sign of weakness!\"\n\nA clamor ripples through the rest of Caiatl's advisors. Only Valus Forge remains silent.\n\n\"Inaction is anathema,\" says Tha'arec. \"Our warriors long for the glory of battle, not the dormancy of a blockade.\"\n\n\"Even if it means fighting for Calus,\" sneers Ca'aurg. He spits the name as if it were made of bile.\n\nA bitter fury builds in Caiatl toward her father. He had ushered in an era of decadence that left the Cabal military dull and complacent; she had sought to be a different kind of leader. But her people remain adrift—this time, among the stars. Perhaps her defectors prefer the pleasure of certain death over the agony of uncertain survival. Or perhaps, she is merely the next in line to lead the empire to ruin.\n\n\"The Leviathan reappeared with no warning,\" Caiatl declares. \"We do not know what else lurks beyond our sight. Our blockade may soon see more battle than we bargained for. Until then, we hold the line.\"\n\nShe speaks in a tone that brooks no argument. Her advisors leave the room, wisely keeping any further misgivings to themselves. Saladin nods to her, as if to say he and he alone agrees with her decision.\n\nCaiatl can only wonder if she agrees with it herself."

The trinket is all that remains of a life's work lost to time, consumed by the Collapse and the ensuing Dark Age.\n\nLike so many other things.\n\nAs he stands at the window, brooding in shame and guilt as he silently contemplates the Traveler, Zavala hears a knock on his door.\n\n\"Come in,\" he calls over his shoulder.\n\nA moment later, Amanda Holliday steps into the room. Dark circles frame her eyes, and her shoulders slump with a weight unseen. No Nightmare hovers behind her, hounding her every step, but she seems haunted, nonetheless. Zavala is certain that, given his own ordeals, he must look much the same.\n\n\"Hey,\" Amanda says quietly as she crosses over to his desk. She leans against it and joins him looking out over the City.\n\nThey stand in silence for a long time and watch a small fleet of civilian ships weave its way between the buildings. The clicking of pendulums marks the time as it drifts past them.\n\n\"The Last City,\" Amanda murmurs. \"Wish my folks had lived to see it.\"\n\n\"As do I,\" Zavala solemnly replies.\n\n\"You would've liked them,\" Amanda says with a sad smile. \"As stubborn as they were kind. They gave everything to make sure I reached the City. Bravest people I've ever known.\"\n\n\"Devotion inspires bravery,\" Zavala says, almost absently. He turns from the window and glances at a low shelf, where a cracked white mask is displayed under glass. \"Bravery inspires sacrifice. And sacrifice…\" his voice quavers as it trails off.\n\n\"…is worth it for the ones we love,\" says Amanda. \"My parents didn't have the Light. But they had me.\"\n\nShe meets his eyes, her own filled with a light all their own. \"We can't all live forever. But being remembered? That's the next best thing.\"\n\nAmanda laughs and sniffles at the same time. \"Didn't mean to talk your ear off. Sorry about that.\"\n\n\"Don't be,\" Zavala replies with a small smile and a sigh of sadness. \"I just wish I could return the favor.\"\n\nHe moves from the window and leans on the desk next to her, gazing out at the Traveler and the Last City as they settle into a comfortable silence. The pendulums on his desk continue to click and clack, the echo of a life lived long, long ago."

Amanda wrings her hands together.\n\n\"How did you all forgive him?\" Her voice sounds small, but her words pierce the cool night air.\n\n\"Not all of us did,\" Mithrax replies solemnly. \"To this day, there are some in House Light who avoid him. Those who lost loved ones to his rage. Though he would give his life to protect them, nothing he can do will ever erase their pain.\"\n\n\"So, they'll just… go on hating him? Forever?\"\n\nMithrax exhales deeply into his rebreather. \"One cannot choose who forgives them and who does not,\" he answers. \"That is the decision of those who were wronged. A choice each must make for themselves.\"\n\nAmanda nods to herself. \"Was afraid you'd say something like that,\" she remarks sadly.\n\nAs she gets up to leave, she turns to Mithrax one last time.\n\n\"What made you forgive Saint?\"\n\nThe Kell of Light leans back in his chair and stares into the fire like he is looking for something amid the ashes.\n\n\"Because,\" he says quietly, \"I want to be forgiven too.\""

The Vanguard could keep their wretched Hive witchcraft; she had sworn to defeat the Nightmare of Ghaul in single combat and cremate his memory on the pyre of victory.\n\nThat choice had become yet another regret.\n\nA gravelly voice cuts across the room. \"You called for me?\"\n\nCaiatl turns to see Saladin Forge step onto the bridge of her flagship. Her honor guard salutes him and steps aside, making way for his approach as she greets him with a nod.\n\n\"What are your thoughts on Eris Morn?\" Caiatl asks him.\n\nSaladin raises an eyebrow. \"She's endured horrors I can scarcely imagine. And she survived. She clawed her way out of that dark pit and back to the Tower.\"\n\n\"And what do you think about her use of Hive sorcery?\" Caiatl seethes.\n\n\"Many initially distrusted her for it. But were it not for her… expertise, the Last City would have fallen to the Hive long ago,\" Saladin replies.\n\n\"That justifies consorting with such foul power?\"\n\nAt first, Saladin says nothing. Instead, he turns his eyes to the viewport; to the Cabal fleet, arrayed in a blockade surrounding the Leviathan. \n\n\"None opposed allying with your empire more than I did.\" His voice is measured, almost introspective. \"I hated the Cabal. Now, I serve on your War Council.\"\n\nHis eyes meet hers once again. \"Your soldiers wield the same weapons that slaughtered Guardians in the Red War. But that does not make you my enemy. Nor does Hive magic make Eris yours.\"\n\nCaiatl glances at her honor guard. When Saladin first joined her War Council, her soldiers regarded him with equal parts suspicion and contempt. Now they show him the deference and respect befitting the title of Valus. Ghaul would have never condoned it.\n\nBut she is not Ghaul. And that is something she does not regret.\n\n\"Open a channel to the H.E.L.M.,\" she orders. \"I have matters to discuss with the Vanguard.\""

You've seen her tuskless plans fail Torobatl. You've watched her cast aside Cabal tradition to bow to the City and their Light. She fights alongside the very soldiers who slaughter your brethren, while I bend them to my will. Who is the true leader? The answer is clear. If only she had followed me as you do.\n\nFinally. Exalted most of all, you elite few who have stood with their emperor from the beginning, who grew fat with strength in exile: we are blood. As you have shed for me, I will shed for you. My flesh, my riches, my goblets of royal wine. They are yours. You are honored above all, and when our new Cabal stands before eternity, you will be among the first.\n\nI have heard the rumors whispered between you, my subjects. Rumors fed to you by our enemies. Your hope that I have not been vanquished is well placed, for I am so very much alive. You fear that we are defeated, but nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nYou wonder if I am a spirit, if I have become something beyond Cabal, if I have ascended like Acrius did when he cradled the sun in his grasp. Allow me to soothe your curiosity: yes, I have become all you have imagined, and so much more.\n\nThe Guardians believe they hold victory, but soon, they will see the truth they have ignored with such determination: this road is long, but it only has one end. They served to set my plans solidly in the foundations of the universe. Their petty attacks, while tragic in their costs to my dear crew, cannot halt our purpose.\n\nSo, my soldiers… I leave you this task: hold the Leviathan. Show no quarter to those who would walk the halls of your home as invaders. It is your final task before you may be uplifted to sit beside me at the end.\n\nI do not promise that every Cabal standing on the Leviathan will survive this journey, but under my loving watch, you will live and die in nothing less than greatness. What more can a warrior desire but an exciting life and a good death? Have I not given you both?\n\n\n-From the mouth of Amsot, High Scribe to the unbound emperor, Calus, who none can contain:\nRejoice! Praise Calus, who ascends. For he keeps you in his mind, and there you will never die."

She imagines accomplishments he dares not entertain for fear of failure.\n\nThe Nightmare knows this fear. Its adolescent eyes meet his and bore into his soul, laying all his embarrassments bare. It sees him for what he is: a deposed ruler, entombed alive in a golden sarcophagus and left to rot in exile, replaced by one more beloved than he.\n\n\"Always seeking the adoration of others,\" seethes the Nightmare wearing his daughter's face. \"Even from the Witness.\"\n\n\"Silence,\" Calus grumbles. He instinctively reaches for his chalice, but it has long since left his side.\n\n\"It will abandon you. Just like the Cabal, just like the Ghost Primus.\"\n\nThe Nightmare of Caiatl smiles, sweet and crimson and full of hatred. \"Just like your daughter.\"\n\n\"I said be silent,\" Calus sputters.\n\nHis daughter's laughter is a knife between his ribs, as it always has been.\n\n\"No one hears your edicts. No one obeys.\"\n\nHer voice fills his chamber and seeps into every crevice of his mind.\n\n\"She is empress now.

Who was speaking? \n\n\"Answer,\" said the voice, convincing and commanding. \n\nEramis paused. As if in response, her perception began to dim, and she felt the crushing darkness closing in around her once more. There was no fight here. This was no choice. \n\nShe remembered her people.\n\nYes, she thought. And the pain ceased.\n\n\"Gather those who would serve you, and know you serve us.\"\n\nA surge of images filled her mind: tendrils of inky vapor trailing through the stars, hidden vessels secreted amongst long-forgotten treasures, a whisper rising to a roar, the Great Machine beginning to—\n\n\"Awaken.\"\n\nAnd then, from everywhere, shattering.\n\n***\n\nArask sat in the heart of his Ketch, lit only by the weak amber glow of his viewscreen.

I can only imagine what the Techeuns have dreamed up for him.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" the commander said, \"turning an asylum-seeker over to the Awoken would needlessly provoke the Eliksni.\" He tried to keep his tone light, but it betrayed him as he felt the seeds of an argument start to form.\n\n\"True,\" Ikora shrugged, \"but Spider's very presence in the City is a provocation.

He was welcoming to Guardians when most of the Shore was still a war zone.\"\n\n\"Is that how you're framing his Ghost shell collection? Cultural exchange?\" Ikora wrinkled her nose in distaste. \"That's a mark against on my ledger.\" \n\n\"Mine as well,\" Zavala replied. \"But we have to accept the Eliksni for who they are. Warts and all. If we're going to live with them, we have to understand them. And nobody understands both sides like Spider.\"\n\n\"And second?\" Ikora prompted.\n\n\"We never know who might become an ally.\" Zavala gestured in the direction of the Eliksni Quarter below. \"The number of Guardians that Mithrax has killed over the years…\" He trailed off with a shake of his head.\n\n\"But now Mithrax fights for the Last City as his home,\" he continued, turning back to Ikora. \"It was unimaginable even a decade ago, but here we are. And in Eido, I see the first real hope for collective peace in my lifetime. Not just a cease-fire, but a real peace.\"\n\nZavala shrugged. \"In a century or two, who knows what Spider might become.\"\n\nIkora narrowed her eyes and pressed her lips together in firm disapproval.

A metal worktable with a neat arrangement of medical equipment, carefully kept. Half of a Thrall's skull, a saw resting at its side. A collection of discarded chitin. A skein of Hive leather.\n\nDrifter picked up a jar from a shelf. The container was filled with pickled Hive eyeballs, the green dimmed by death.\n\n\"You live like this?\" Drifter asked, incredulous. Eris looked at him with a frown.\n\n\"What do you mean? Like what?\"\n\nDrifter gestured around the room. When she said nothing, he continued.\n\n\"You called the Derelict a heap.\"\n\nShe switched on one of the harsh halogen lamps hanging over her worktable. The light cast everything in hard lines of shadow.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"So what d'you call this?\" He shook the jar of eyeballs. They rolled and thumped together in their glass container before settling into a teeming stare.\n\nEris silently returned her gaze to the reliquary. It was an unassuming vessel, its contents obscured, save for a strange interior glow.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, the Scribe of House Light has examined these,\" Eris said. \"Why bring one to me?\"\n\n\"Eido ain't exactly a Darkness expert.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nShe felt the grooves and patterns under her fingertips as she turned the reliquary in her hands. She felt the shift and shudder of the Darkness as it responded to her touch—to her silent inquiry. She ran the pad of her thumb over the seal's edges.\n\nWhen Drifter had first offered the relics to her, Eris had called them a gift. Now that she had one in her hands, she did not think she should unwrap it. She looked back to him.\n\n\"What is your motivation for helping the Guardian? I do not assume altruism.\"\n\nDrifter gave her a look of mock offense. \"Hey, why not?\"\n\n\"Hm. I did assume deflection. Speak plainly.\"\n\nDrifter fell silent for a moment. His face was pensive. When he finally spoke, his words were carefully chosen.\n\n\"The Eliksni need a win,\" he said, looking away from her. \"After all that—the Vex, Salvation, everything—House Light needs a win.\"\n\n\"And defeating Eramis will be 'a win'?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Hope it sticks this time.\"\n\nDrifter leaned back on his heels and grinned. \"Plus, always nice to be owed a favor. Don't know if Spider'll make good on his… But I bet Captain Kell would.\"\n\nAgain, deflection. She placed the reliquary down on her worktable. Drifter didn't move to pick it up.\n\n\"You sure you don't want to keep 'em?\"\n\nHis tone was genuine. Eris considered this. Not the offer, but the sentiment behind his words. The implicit, unspoken faith.\n\n\"You trust me?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Who wouldn't?\"\n\nThere was a smile—slight, careful—at the corner of her mouth. Something close to delight.\n\n\"Then stay, be silent, and listen. I have thoughts on their utility.\"\n\nDrifter did as she asked."

Those at the top of the Tower, for instance.\"\n\nMithrax noted a few sharp scoffs amongst the crowd at Spider's mention of the Tower.\n\n\"I wish to make clear the rules of the Eliksni Quarter,\" Mithrax said, \"so that there are no… misunderstandings.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Spider proclaimed with faux deference. \"Misunderstandings are how people get… left behind. We wouldn't want that.\"\n\nMithrax huffed at Spider's indelicate allusion. His retort was interrupted by a polite chitter at his side. He looked down to see the Dreg from behind the bar proffer a small Ether canister.\n\nMithrax attached the Ether canister to his rebreather and took a sharp pull. He was pleasantly surprised by the sensation. It was at once filling and effervescent. The House of Light had been living on the most basic Ether for so long that he forgot how delightful such concoctions were.

Especially when you kill dozens of them at a time.\"\n\nMithrax ignored the jab and pressed on. \"That is why there must be no violence inside the City walls. Ever.\"\n\n\"This is the Eliksni Quarter, is it not?\" Spider bristled. \"The Eliksni should be free to mete out justice as needed… in our own way.\"\n\n\"I did not say there must be no violence,\" Mithrax muttered in sotto voce. \"Only that it must not happen inside the walls.\"\n\nSpider nodded at the concession. \"Very crafty. Agreed. Is that all?\"\n\n\"No. That is not all. From today forward, there will be no more docking in your organization.\" He nodded toward the Dreg behind the bar, whose lower arm stumps were covered with studded leather caps.\n\n\"What!\" Spider exclaimed. \"That's preposterous! Eliksni have been docking Dregs since the Whirlwind—it's tradition!\" The crowd murmured restlessly at the prospect of confrontation.\n\n\"Not in my House,\" Mithrax boomed. The room went silent. \n\nMithrax turned to address the crowd. \"I am Kell, and I decree that no Eliksni in the House of Light shall be docked.\" He turned back to Spider and lowered his voice. \"Unless you wish to be the exception to the rule.\"\n\nSpider chuckled. \"There's the Misraaks I knew,\" he said slyly. \"As long as you're still willing to draw blades when the time comes, we'll be just fine.\""

Crow looked at the big Eliksni, took a measured breath, and saw him plainly: as someone sleeping alone in a city of enemies. \n\nHe looked around the tawdry interior of the bar, decorated with what scraps Spider had managed to bring as he fled the Shore for the safety of the Last City, where he now survived on the charity of Drifter and Mithrax alone.\n \nCrow shook his head with a smile and pulled the knife from the stool before sliding it into its sheath.

Saint stared at the bar's entrance and slowly spun the cylinder on his hand cannon with a methodical click, click, click.\n\nThey glanced at each other and shared a nod. They were ready for trouble.\n\nWhen the Titans stepped through the saloon doors, the whole crowd froze. The Guardians towered above the seated patrons, their helmeted heads the blank visages of death. They slowly stalked the perimeter of the room, moving in opposite directions, optimizing their fields of fire, prioritizing their targets.\n\nThe Humans in the room slowly crept toward the exit and, once clear of the doorway, bolted into the night. The Eliksni edged their many hands toward wire rifles and Arc spears.\n\nThere was a moment of silence before the coming storm.\n\n* * *\n\nA short time later, disarray filled the room: Eliksni lay strewn across the floor.

The Wretches approached in a line, holding hands to create a chain. Then slowly, solemnly, the two Wretches on either end reached out in unison and grabbed Saint's fist.\n\nThe Wretches' cloth wrappings sizzled, and the lenses on their helmets flared as the Arc coursed through them. However, they did not break contact, and the circuit remained intact.\n\nFrom a nearby table, Shaxx's massive voice counted out, \"…SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN!\"\n\nSaint let his Light ebb, and the Wretches staggered backward. There was a moment of silence before Shaxx boomed, \"And the winner is… THE SKIFFBLADES!\"\n\nHalsiks, a Vandal in service to the Guardian, leapt into the arms of the Wretches, and the four of them bounced up and down in jubilation. An Eliksni lying on the floor feebly lifted their upper arms in celebration.\n\n\"The next round,\" Shaxx continued, \"is on the great Titan, the Violet King… THE SAINT!\"\n\nSaint-14 nodded grudgingly to the Dreg behind the bar, who was peering over the edge in apprehension. Any Eliksni who could still walk began mobbing the bar for a concoction at the Titan's expense.\n\nHalsiks approached Saint and tapped at his metal breastplate playfully. He drummed a complex polyrhythm and chittered excitedly. \n\n\"Yes, you're welcome,\" Saint replied dourly. \"But don't get used to it!

It didn't calm her.\n\nShe stood within one of the half-ruined rooms of the Eliksni Quarter. Privacy was a luxury in this place, and Eido took it where she could.

But her Scribe's logs were unencrypted. She realized now how naïve that had been.\n\nShe took another breath. Eido had reached out to Eramis before, calling for Eliksni unity, and did not think she would receive a reply. But now she knew that Eramis had listened. The Kell had reached out in turn.

A pain Eido had never known—a pain she realized her father had tried to keep from her. \n\n\"Eido,\" Misraaks said, appearing at the threshold of the door.

Eido sighed, her thoughts still racing.\n\nEramis had said she could not turn away from her violence or her vengeance. Eido did not believe that—she could not believe it. This violence was not the Kell's spirit. Eido had to find the part of Eramis that did not rage at the past. Eido had to show the Kell of Darkness a future.\n\nSilently, the Scribe of House Light began piecing together the coordinates to the next hideout herself."

        "text": "My family named me Ithriiks—\"sturdy heart\"—and held me aloft in the shadow of the Great Machine. My birth name was chosen to extol my strength as a hatchling; my chosen name would be aspirational. On my third molting, I chose the name Inaaks, \"gentle hands.\" I would be the greatest weaver our house had ever known. I was so sure of it.\n\nThen our world ended. Then… I was sure of nothing.\n\nThe end of our civilization came from the outside in, like a hand slowly closing around a throat. At first, it didn't feel real: Riis was gone, and my House was trapped aboard a Ketch, knowing that there was nothing at our backs. For so long, we broadcasted distress calls into the dark, hoping for others on the Long Drift to find us and offer succor. Help never came. Every satellite world we visited, the story was the same: desolation, death, despair. Weeks of searching turned into years, and I feared we were the only ship that slipped between those proverbial fingers of destruction. Were we the last? We had to continue hoping it wasn't so.\n\nAs we drifted among the stars, we inevitably lost members of our House along the way. I wove the finest memorial shrouds for our dead, so that they could rest in security and peace. Then, as the eggcloth ran out, we could not give them the dignity of binding. My gentle hands were eventually used to separate dead meat from carapace. We would not starve in the dark.\n\nMy son was brought into a world of isolation, abandonment, and suffering. I should have crushed his egg and woven it into cloth; a regret I will always carry. My sentimentality for the old world won out, and bitter hope for the future stayed my hand. I named him after my father. I did not know if we would carry on our House's tradition of birth names and chosen names. What purpose did it serve now? What did it matter?\n\nMy son's father died weeks after the birth. He was not missed. It was better that way. His death was something I did not regret.\n\nIt would be years before we encountered another Ketch. It bore the sigil of the House of Dancers, renowned for their skill with machines and their generosity to those in need. Their Kell agreed to send an emissary to discuss our needs. I knew this emissary, Eramis, when we were children. All I knew of her in adulthood was that she had a wife and hatchlings. \n\nI had hoped the Whirlwind had taken it all from her. I hated myself for wanting that. \n\nEramis was no longer the meek child I once knew; that much was certain when I greeted her aboard my Ketch. She brought two hatchlings with her, just barely old enough to walk on their own. They were mischievous little things, the round one constantly trying to tug the taller one's arms off until Eramis disciplined them. I carried my son, swaddled to my chest, as a show of trust.\n\nNegotiations between us were tense. I quickly realized that the House of Dancers had no interest in sharing their resources, but rather in assessing our own vulnerabilities. When it was clear to Eramis that we could not be easily disabled and stripped of our Ether, we found a \"compromise.\" House of Dancers would be supplied with materials for repairs and, in turn, we would take on some of their people, along with a fractional store of Ether. She was sending them to die, with us, rather than condemn them to the cold and uncaring depths of space where her people could see. I learned who Eramis had become, and what ideals she lived by: \"Two hands in greeting, two hands concealed.\"\n\nIt was an inequitable deal, and Eramis knew it. \"Your alternative is death,\" she offered me. \nA coward's voice slipped out of my mouth when I declined that choice. I asked her where her wife was, hoping I would inspire her to feel, for a moment, as hopeless as I did. She did not so much as flinch, then foisted the two hatchlings onto me. They were not hers, as I had assumed, but the first of the House of Dancers that we would take in the exchange.\n\nToo many hands and not enough Ether to go around. The simplest solution was also the most difficult one. We had to find a way to thin our numbers again."

        "text": "We had sailed the Long Drift for centuries, but I had yet to come to terms with our new reality. My son had only borne witness to a fraction of it. He was still young, still struggling to understand his place in the world. The two children from the House of Dancers, Rakis and Siviks, were slightly older and had become his reluctant friends. They protected him from the adolescents who would steal his Ether when I wasn't looking. It was not a family to me, not truly. I had yet to understand that Ketch is kin.\n\nOnce we found the Great Machine, we learned that it had uplifted a whole new species, granted them power beyond anything it had ever bestowed to us. That betrayal drove some in our House to despair, others to death, and many to violence. Adapting to this betrayal was to be our next challenge. I listened to the poison-minded advice of soft-shelled cowards and tried to speak with the Great Machine's new chosen—our usurpers.\n\nThey repaid the Machine's kindness with violence. Killed three of my closest friends. I later discovered that they shucked their carapaces and wore their chitin as armor. We learned all we could about these usurpers, like how their limbs were supple and could be pulled from their bodies far easier than our own kind. I came to love the sound of their screams.\n\nIf violence was the only language they spoke, so be it. Time had made me fluent.\n\nSome of my House refused to abandon the old ways. The fools draped themselves in the naïve raiment of Splicers, praying to a god that doomed us all. They could contemplate their failure with what was left of their lives in the cold dark. I had no time for them, save for goading them into raids. If we wanted to retake the Great Machine, we would not do it by prostrating ourselves like weeping children. We would take it back by force.\n\nWe killed the Machine's chosen, taking what we could, rooting through the rotten innards of their dying world. We took refuge in the shadows of their dusty moon where the usurper's ruins stuck out like bones from the dust. It was empty, it was silent, but there was value to be had in picking those old bones clean.\n\nOn one such expedition, I had strapped my son to me and set out to pick over a bounty of bones. But it was not the spools of spincable, the plates of hardsheet, or the fragments of clearcut that proved most valuable. It was what we found buried beneath the bones. What was buried deep.\n\nWe traversed that day into dark tunnels, where something hideous festered beneath this moon's surface. Horrific creatures that stank of wet soil, shrieked like dying animals, and tore at flesh. They possessed a ferocity we had never seen before, and my raiding party was being whittled down one by one. But when it seemed like these creatures were to finish the rest of us off… they relented.\n\nThey appeared to hear something. Something that terrified them. Something that left us to wonder: what are monsters afraid of? The creatures scurried back into their warrens and vanished into the subterranean temple they spilled out of. And for a moment, I thought I heard something too. Something soft, a whisper. But as forceful as a scream. That was when we saw it, situated in a rift beyond the temple. The true treasure of this dusty tomb.\n\nA pyramid of jet black, opening its doors for us."

        "text": "My mother could not keep me swaddled to her chest forever. I was no longer a child, and no longer in need of sheltering. I was my own person, and it was time that she understood that. I knew that she loved me. Because she shared her Ether with me. Because she killed those who harmed me. Because she wanted better for me than the life we had. But we are not always the arbiters of our own fate. \n\nI aspired to nothing short of her approval. She was our inspiration, our leader, our hope. Kell of our House and protector of our people. She who gave me a name that meant \"strength above all else.\" She named me Misraaks, and I was now strong enough to bear it.\n\nOn the day I told her I was capable of raiding at her side, we sat together in the cargo hold of our Ketch. There was not the pride in her eyes I had hoped for. She was transfixed by the medallion around my neck, an icon of the Great Machine. One I had taken from the corpse of a Splicer. One I had earned through blood. She tore it from my neck, crushed it in her hand. \n\n\"This will not protect you!\" she shouted at me. \"This will only lead you to death!\" I had never feared my mother before, but I had never seen her look at me the way she did that day. She pushed me up against a wall with her upper arms and pressed the bent charm against my brow. \"No son of mine will beg for scraps in the shadow of the Abandoner.\"\n\nBut even as she threatened me, I felt her press something into one of my hands: a reliquary, one of the few she had forged from the treasures of the Moon. She saw the recognition on my face and stepped back, releasing me. I could tell she wanted me to inspect it. I had never seen one of the reliquaries up close before, and though the glass was clear, the oily fluid inside obscured everything embalmed within. Yet still, I felt its presence worming behind my eyes like roots of a great tree burrowing into soil.\n\nIt whispered to me. Not with words, but with promises blooming behind my eyes in visions of glory. When I looked up to my mother, I asked her why we could not have both. Why we could not seek the power we had stolen from the Moon and simultaneously earn the right to seek refuge beneath the Great Machine once more. \n\n\"You are brave and curious,\" My mother mused, \"But you do not yet understand the brutality of the world.\" Then she showed me. She drove a knife into my side, twisted it, and split my carapace apart. I did not give her the satisfaction of hearing me scream. \n\n\"Let this be your first lesson,\" she said to me. \"You are my crew now, and when your crew questions your leadership, you make an example of them.\"\n\nShe drew the knife out of my side and handed it to me. \"Never forget that.\"\n\nI promised her I wouldn't."

        "text": "We had discovered a ship full of Human usurpers hiding behind one of the moons of a dusty red world they called Mars. Generations of survivors cowering on a derelict colony ship since the Great Machine failed them. Siviks, Rakis, and I led the raiding party that boarded their vessel. The Humans were malnourished and pitiful, yet they still tried to fight us.\n\nThe battle was short and brutal. I watched Rakis rip a usurper's arms out of the sockets and throw them to the floor. He was so strong back then. We all were. Our growing Ether shares were intoxicating, as was the bloodlust of unrestricted violence. Rakis was massive, even then. Stronger than all of us. One of the Human champions—if they could be called such—challenged Rakis. The rest of us stood by as he tore the Human's limbs off, one by one, and then crushed what was left of the champion's head between his hands. The other Humans threw down their arms and begged for the lives of those who did not fight. Noble, but foolish.\n\nI corralled the survivors into an airlock and sealed them inside. Rakis and Siviks disagreed with me on how we should handle them. Rakis suggested that they would be more valuable in servitude, rather than be given to the cold dark. \"Imagine it,\" he asked of me, \"usurpers wearing the sigil of our House, doing our bidding for us.\"\n\nSiviks seemed amused by this notion. \"Usurpers serving us,\" he said with delight. \"We could steal back the Great Machine's favor by taking from them their identity.\"\n\nRakis reached for the airlock controls, and I struck his hand away. He looked at me with confusion, and attempted again, disrespecting my leadership in front of the others. I knew I had to do something. \n\nWithout hesitation, I evacuated the airlock into space, killing our captives. The brothers, angered, fought back. I held honor to my aspirations. Strength above all. I butchered half the Dregs loyal to Rakis and Siviks, then turned my blades on the brothers. In spite of their struggle, they ended the battle at my feet, half their followers dead and the others huddled in fear. My mother was fluent in the language of violence, but I was eloquent.\n\nI marooned Rakis and Siviks on an asteroid for their final punishment, along with their surviving crew and left them with a knife and my mother's lesson: \"When your crew questions your leadership, you make examples of them.\"\n\nI returned to our Ketch, towing the derelict colony ship. When I told my mother what had become of Rakis and Siviks, I expected her to approve; but instead, I saw something haunted in her eyes. I thought she was ashamed of me, of what I had done, but I was only following her example. I was victorious, and yet in victory, I felt emptier than in any failure.\n\nIt was not until much later that I realized the truth. My mother was not ashamed of me.\n\nShe was ashamed of herself."

It was a time when social strictures were lifted, and Humans were permitted to cross the boundaries of nature and society. \n\nIt appears that most Humans used this license to contact their ancestors, similar to the Vanguard's severance rituals aboard the Leviathan. However, it is entirely possible that more adventurous practitioners used the power of the pumpkins to create entirely new beings: the Headless Ones.\n\nI'm grateful to Glint for conclusively proving the existence of these reclusive creatures. However, my subsequent research with the Guardian leads me to challenge his conclusions regarding their origins. This debate is likely to continue as long as Lightbearers retain their ghoulish taste for the Headless Ones' loot, and their visceral 'candy' innards.\""

They keep us all safe. And how do we tell them \"Thank you?\" By remembering them!\n\nToday, we will learn about Stargazer. A stargazer is someone who looks into the sky and studies the stars. The Cloud Strider who picked Stargazer as their call sign was very smart.\n\nOur planet, Neptune, is a hidden world. It is very large, but with our thick atmosphere and powerful magnetic field, it is very hard to see anything on the surface. This hides our city and keeps us safe, but it also hides the universe from us. We could see the stars but not study them.\n\nStargazer was the first person to learn how to use math to see the sky!\n\nAnd Stargazer didn't just see stars. They also saw Earth. Do you know about Earth, children? That's right! Earth is a planet closer to the Sun, and it's where humans came from a long time ago. We thought there were no humans left on the Earth, and we could not see to check.\n\nBut when Stargazer looked to Earth, they saw more humans!\n\nBut Earth is a very dangerous place now. The people there do not go to school, and they do not go to market. Instead, they are bullied by the warlords, who force them to do things instead of asking nicely.\n\nStargazer worried what would happen if the warlords ever found Neptune. They might bully us, too! Our world is very hard to find, and the people of Earth had forgotten about our tiny colony ship. But on Earth, they have computers, too, and the warlords might learn of us just like we learn about the stars.\n\nStargazer traveled to Earth and used a special computer called a Warmind to make all the other computers on Earth forget about Neptune.\n\nToday, we still watch Earth, and when the warlords are gone, we will go back and help the people there clean up their world. Just like when you help your parents clean up! And doesn't everyone like having a clean home?\n\nThat's all for today, niños. Three, two, one! Now, have fun!

They keep us all safe. And how do we tell them \"Thank you?\" By remembering them!\n\nToday, we will learn about Bluejay. The blue jay is a very clever bird. You might have seen one in the parklands. Some can even talk! The Cloud Strider who picked Bluejay as his call sign was very clever.\n\nMany Cloud Striders are soldiers or engineers, but Bluejay was a game designer. Do you know what a game designer is, children?\n\nThat's right! A game designer makes vidgames! Maybe you have played a vidgame with your parents in the CloudArk. Bluejay was the very first person to make a vidgame in the CloudArk! Before that, we did not know it was a whole world. We could not use it to make art or visit friends. We just put things in it to save them for later, like the closet. And the closet seems scary at first, doesn't it, niños? But if you are brave, you can find lots of fun things inside!\n\nSo Bluejay helped us expand how we use the CloudArk—he made it a place we could play or even live, if we needed to. And when he made his game in there, he also learned that the Vex used the CloudArk, too. They could not get in, but the CloudArk was so strong they could use it to do their work for them even from outside, using the force of the Veil to turn their own machines, like when the wind turns a turbine.\n\nBluejay learned he could jump from the CloudArk to the Vex network, and he sabotaged their machines from the inside. The Vex were very confident and did not think he could find them, so they were careless. And so Bluejay scared them, and they ran away! And what we learned is that being careless with the CloudArk is dangerous, isn't it? That's why you always close your open ports and keep your passcode secret, because the Vex remember being scared, and they'll frighten you to get us back.\n\nThat's all for today, niños.

Do you know what it means?\n\nA maelstrom is a big storm. A maelstrom is loud and scary, and it can cause a lot of damage. The Cloud Strider who picked Maelstrom as her call sign was also loud and scary. But she wasn't scary to us. She was scary to the Vex. She was a strong warrior who could fight as well as any of the Vex, but she was also a very smart leader who taught all the other people on Neptune how to defend ourselves.\n\nAnd do you know what she did? She started a special school called the Assur Academy. And you can go there today, if you study hard and you want to learn to be a good leader like Maelstrom. They even train new Cloud Striders!\n\nBut, today, we mostly remember Maelstrom because she saved the whole city from the Uplift Coven. The Uplift Coven were humans, like you, but they were selfish and mean. Good people talk out their differences and find ways to fix their problems that help everyone. But the Uplift Coven hurt people and stole from people, and they all wanted to be Cloud Striders.\n\nWhy shouldn't more people be Cloud Striders?\n\nThat's right. Because the Cloud Strider sacrifices. A Cloud Strider must have affinity, awareness, and altruism. You cannot be a Cloud Strider if you demand things from other people.\n\nMaelstrom made the Uplift Coven stop, and now we are very careful to teach everyone to be better citizens when they are young.

And you're not my supervisor.\" She waved him off and turned back to the schedule with the other medtechs.\n\n\"How do they expect us to receive this many people in one shift?\" Tammiya pulled a copy of the schedule file and integrated it into her arm—half the staff were already taking advantage of the transience of \"virtual tattoos\" to keep important notes accessible.\n\nTino perked up at the chance to gossip. \"You didn't hear? Over on Wakeside, they had an anaphylaxis event last shift. Some chucklehead forgot to tell them about his shellfish allergy.\"\n\n\"But the new cathepsin inhibitors are oyster-derived.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Miku confirmed. Her avatar hung slack. \"They pumped him full of deepsleep, and he puffed up like a fugu. Puked everywhere! Glad I was only there on drone duty because the smell must have been a nightmare.\" Tino brought up the video feed.\n\n\"Why do people think we even ask all these questions?\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Bijan settled into a virtual chair at the briefing table. The supervisor's cold glare survived CloudArk transition unaffected. \"People get scared, and they forget things. It's part of being human. Do your jobs like professionals.\"\n\n\"But we were already behind, chief. And then people like this slow it down for everyone else.\"\n\n\"I get the frustration, Tammiya.\" Bijan pulled the schedule apart into their respective assignments. \"But we're medical technicians. We're the stability they need. You wear your empathy first.\"\n\n\"Good call, chief,\" Tino piped in.\n\n\"Speaking of… Tino, you can be math on your own time. But while we have five million scared patients looking for reassurance, keep your damn face on.\""

She made a mental note to thank her boss: the easiest way to put seniors at ease was to ask about family.\n\nHe wiped a tear from his eye, then clapped his hands on her desk. \"So. You need to freeze me?\"\n\n\"That's a common misconception.\" She had tried for weeks to dispel this one, but the term \"cryo\" had caught on and was too easy. \"It's more like a hibernation. We'll lower your body temperature and metabolic activity, but your mind will remain active in the CloudArk.\"\n\n\"Oh? I used to do some arking back in my day. Been a while, though. Mostly just use the AV stuff to visit the great-grandkids.\" He made a point of shifting in the chair. \"The monorail's not great for the old scoliosis.\"\n\n\"I don't think anyone calls it 'arking' anymore, Mr. Mendoza, but you'll be able to see the grandkids just like an in-person visit.\"\n\nShe kicked on the viewing wall and displayed an image of Neomuna, except…\n\n\"No clouds?\" He whistled appreciatively.\n\n\"We call it the Landing Zone. It's an exact replica of the city. Same laws of physics. Just nicer weather. You'll start out here while you get used to CloudArk living. We generate a body that's an exact replica of the one you have now. Once you get settled in, we have classes for customizing your avatar, building new spaces, even exploring the deep CloudArk if you feel adventurous.\"\n\n\"Sounds good, I suppose.

Isn't that enticing?\"\n\n\"No. Because your sister's forbidden it, Uldren.\"\n\n\"That,\" he says, cheerfully, \"is how I know it's worth doing.\" And because the Awoken people will thrill at another tale of his narrow survival.

A perfect sphere of topologically defective space-time blinks into being around him. He holds Jolyon close, and together they calm their breath. The barrier is impenetrable, but it will not last long. Until then there is only so much air to breathe.\n\nOutside, the full fury of a Cabal fleet carrier lands on the Gate Lord.\n\nWhen the barrier fades, the Gate Lord is dead, and Uldren and Jolyon are no longer on Mars."

Tiny squirming things shaped like wet microchips mill in the exposed soil.\n\n\"I don't like this place,\" Jolyon whispers. \"We should get back to the surface…\"\n\nHe means the Garden's surface, the manicured sectors of red flowers that stretch away toward a distant mesa. But it's far too Vex up there, Uldren thinks. They've been in here, gardening, moving earth, making walls, building their ancient constructs of stone and light. Trying to tame this place.\n\n\"It's life,\" he breathes. \"You're right, Jol. Everything grows here…\"\n\nHe cannot let this place be killed. He cannot let it be looted and overthrown like everything else that doesn't fit into the narrow binary dogmas of the Traveler's undead warriors. Excitement seizes him and he runs ahead, sloshing through the muck, laughing aloud.\n\n\"Uldren,\" Jolyon shouts after him, \"what are you looking for?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" he cries back. \"That's what's so incredible! I can't know!\""

Uldren moves with cold, vicious anger. War here in the Garden. Petty, detestable war, brought into this place by some blundering Cabal expedition. They deserved what they got. The Garden must be left to tend itself, mustn't it? It must be allowed to evolve its secret fruits…\n\nThe terrain dips. The red flowers fade away to low, woven grasses. The wind whispers… soft words, sentences with just the beginnings of syntax, the cadence almost musical. \"Brain stain,\" Jolyon whispers, fearing infection by a contagious idea. \"We should…\" But his voice trails off as Uldren pushes ahead, down into a low vale, slipping easily through tangled undergrowth. Vex. There are Vex here, dozens of Goblins and Minotaurs, still as statues and covered in moss, in a ring like some robotic henge. They are singing in faint, wraithlike notes of inhuman clarity. Uldren knows what this place must be.\n\nThe Cabal Legionary huddles behind a stone. Uldren creeps forward. By the time the wounded bellowing thing knows he's there, he has a knife pressed to its helmet, right above the cleft of its lips and the soft tissues below. \"Don't move,\" he says, in Ulurant. \"Don't speak. This knife is atom-sharp.\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" the Legionary grunts in its native tongue. \"It's roight up in me eyes. Practically shavin' me bristles.\"\n\n\"Do you know where you are?\"\n\n\"Just abou' the worst place anyone's ever gone?\"\n\n\"You say that because you can't smell the air,\" Uldren says. \"It's sweet. Like pollen and thunder. Why did you come here?\"\n\n\"Not by any chance of oir own, ser. The milk robots abducted us.\"\n\nThe whispers have taken on a soft hint of Ulurant grammar, confirming Uldren's suspicion. This is a place where abstract patterns war for survival, fighting to propagate themselves by preying on each other. The Vex are singing to see how the Garden changes their song, and even this conversation has fertilized the air. \"Why are they here? What do they want?\"\n\n\"They come 'ere to pray, ser. They're makin' vessels ou' of themselves. They're the wors' things ever to be, ser. They 'ate existence.\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\"\n\n\"Oh, frum the seeds, ser,\" the Legionary says. \"Do yeh see them?\" And without hesitation or second thought, he punches the emergency medic release on his helmet. The pressure seal breaks and a ring of black gel sprays out, hissing. The Legionary slumps over. His helmet tumbles into his broad lap.\n\nBeneath the layer of gel, the whole surface of his skull has the pitted texture of a strawberry. Thousands of tiny seeds glisten in the Cabal's flesh. Uldren brushes the skin in fascination.\n\n\"Uldren,\" Jolyon radios, \"I really don't like the expression on your face.\"\n\n\"This place has secrets,\" the prince murmurs back. The bone mic feels cold and inorganic, poorly mated to his flesh, compared to the warm, close-packed pits of the Legionary's deformed skull. \"So many secrets… They grew in him, Jolyon. The Garden grew its secrets in him.\"\n\n\"Who gives a rat?\" Jolyon snaps. \"Your Highness, we've got to get out of here. Before whatever happened to them happens to us too!\"\n\nHe's afraid of secrets, Uldren realizes. The unknown terrifies him. Which is very sensible. Very rational. The attitude of a good scout, a good soldier, a survivor.\n\nBut Uldren can't stop imagining how astonished Mara would be at this place. What if he could bring her here? What if they could explore this place together?"

We will plant it here, in our dominion, where I know it will take root and flourish. It will remind the people of our twin heritage.\"\n\nFor a terrible moment, Mara is unreadable.

Holds it up to the light. \"Magnificent. Illyn, see to it.\"\n\nShe passes it off. Uldren swallows protest. He'd hoped she might plant it herself.\n\nAfterward, in private, she is silent and still.

He was running through a thorny grove, and the branches and prickles were tearing at his cheeks. Huge wet fruits slapped against his shoulders and detonated in overripe pulp. Fruits shaped like heavy, swollen Ghosts. He was huddled with Jolyon beneath a thick cobweb, holding his breath, as they listened to voices argue just outside. His heartbeat… was it his heartbeat? Or another's?\n\nHe was in an apartment block. He remembers that. He was sitting in the laundry room, a place with a black-and-white checkered tile floor, watching his crows tumble over and over in the dryer, black feathers flurrying, beaks clacking. A big old female Cabal sat in the tub to his left, scrubbing her back with a wire brush. A Vex Goblin with the face of Alis Li in its stomach stood behind the counter, selling detergent. \"Uldren,\" she said, \"you've got a hole in you.\" The Cabal grunted in agreement. He looked down at himself and there was a hole in his hand, black and perfectly round. His dryer ran out of time, but his crows were still wet.\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara, shaking him. She does not ordinarily touch anyone. \"Did you see the heart?\"\n\nIt seems the most natural thing in the world that a garden should have a heart. \"The Vex infest the place,\" he says. \"It gives them something they crave. It… grows them toward what they want to be.\"\n\n\"You didn't answer the question,\" Mara says coolly. It's a perfectly sensible observation. It's the strangest thing Uldren has ever heard her say.\n\n\"Whatever the heart of that place is,\" he says, pacing, \"it's a seed, I think, a seed left behind to grow. Like a… a node of Glimmer. Or…\" The idea strikes him as a thunderbolt. \"Or a tripwire. Bait to attract those who seek out and destroy what they don't understand.\"\n\nBait for Guardians. Bait to mark some milestone in the Traveler's recovery.\n\n\"I told you never to go there,\" Mara says. Her eyes burn. She draws her cloak tight. \"Are you not devoted to me?\"\n\n\"Sister,\" he says, \"of course I am.\"\n\n\"Yet you defy me.\"\n\nYes, Uldren thinks. Yes, aren't those the same thing? How could you care at all for something that never surprises you?\n\nHe feels suddenly, utterly alone."

He's not sure how to apologize. He hasn't spoken to Jolyon since they returned from the Garden. He didn't commend Jolyon to the Queen or throw him a fete for his bravery or even ask if he was sleeping all right after… after everything. He forgot about him.\n\n\"Hey,\" Jolyon says, not looking up. \"You weren't at the range yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't even need a spotter,\" Uldren says, trying to tease him. But it comes off flat and dismissive. \"I've been, uh.\" Dreaming. Recording his dreams. Poring feverishly through the Origin Libraries, searching for confirmation of what his heart wants so desperately to be true. The future of the Awoken could lie in that Garden. There is a wellspring of Light on Earth, a blinding beacon that will only grow brighter. The Awoken will not survive, not as they are; Mara's vision and the truth of their origins will be lost, diluted by the anodyne philosophy of those Cityborn ideologues. The Guardians will kill everything they find.\n\nWhat if the Garden is the Traveler's antithesis? What if the Awoken can find in that Garden a new place of balance, an equipotential between the darkness and the light? As the light brightens the shadows deepen—\n\nJolyon is saying something. \"Sorry,\" Uldren grunts, fussing with his revolver. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"I said, we should talk about what happened in there.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" He realizes now how afraid he was that Jolyon wouldn't see the significance of the place. Revulsion and fear, yes, natural responses, but he must see past them. \"Yes, we've got to record all our observations before they fade. I should've asked you sooner—\"\n\n\"Uldren, I don't want anyone to know what we saw.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" This kindles a little bonfire of warmth in his gut. \"Of course. No one else has to know. Our shared secrets, hm?\"\n\n\"I wish I didn't remember what I saw,\" Jolyon says, fumbling his rifle's firing pin. It hits the floor like a dull chime and rolls under his bench. He doesn't go after it. \"And I don't keep secrets.\"\n\nUldren thinks about this for a moment. The profound truth of it hits him like a cold wind. \"You don't, do you?\" Jolyon knows exactly where he was born, to what lineage. His capabilities as a marksman are public record. As one of Uldren's Crows, he flies dangerous surveillance missions, but he is not a covert operative. Uldren knows… everything about him.\n\n\"You gonna be on the range tomorrow?\" Jolyon asks, too casually. \"Thought we might shoot a few magazines.\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow,\" Uldren says. \"I have work to do.\" He is already trying to imagine how Mara would react if he tries to turn the Oracle Engine on the Garden. The things he might learn… the things she will surely want to know…"

As he staggers down the edge of a Martian chasm, he can feel the drop calling to him, begging him to join her. To end it all. The heat of the place soaks him in sweat. The dead chassis of one of his old Crow drones, slung over his back, feels like it's compressing his ribs, pushing his lungs up against his sternum, expelling his breath.\n\nHe needs the drone to fix his ship. Again. He must get off Mars. He must start looking for her.\n\nThe weight of the Crow drone slams him down on hands and knees. His vision swims—stars and shining Harbingers soaring through the ring plane and a wall of terrible light—and he sees the moment the Dreadnaught took everything from him, the moment his sister finally, absolutely, utterly ran out of secret plans. That instant when all sound ceased and he screamed denial and yet—in spite of his soul's plea to die with her—reached for the deflection shield that saved his life.\n\nHe crawls until he can rest in the shadow of a dead Vex block.\n\nHe crashed in the Candor Isles, not so far from the Gate to the Garden. The place where he saw another path for the Awoken. Why had Mara never accepted his invitation?\n\nHe has been hearing her. Thirst hallucinations, surely. But there is that hum, that whisper, that thrill of starlight in his skull…\n\nA flock of his Crow drones found his crash site and repaired his fighter. He made it halfway to orbital velocity before a Cabal gun clawed him out of the sky and sent him crashing down in Hellas Basin. Now his Crows are dead and the fighter is probably beyond repair. And his sister is gone. His sister is GONE. And he followed her and all his people followed her because he and they were sure she had a PLAN she always had a PLAN something better than DYING BY THE THOUSANDS FOR A CITY THAT DOES NOT CARE.\n\nHe should go home. He should go home. If he can find a way. But will he have the strength? He cannot be the champion they loved. He cannot restore their faith in the purpose of the Awoken, or in his sister's design. He no longer believes.\n\nThis world is a carcass now. The scars of the Guardians' passage. Cabal fortresses reeking of decay, littered with flesh and bone and broken armor. The shattered chassis of Vex littering the sands. A place of death, death and war, a war that tilts on the fulcrum of the Traveler, brought upon it by the puppets of that Traveler, that fulcrum of war.\n\nThere is something in his eye. He blinks and blinks, trying to rub it away, and as he does, he struggles to hear her, to sense that prickle of starlight under his skin. She will tell him he is on the right path.

Prince Uldren of a ruined house, lesser of two siblings, bested by Skolas, blinded by Variks Less-Than-Dreg, squanderer of fleets, last of the Awoken nobility, last of his kind.\n\nWhen Uldren looks up at him, he does not even need to speak the truth. The Kell of Kings has named Uldren, and in doing so, it has named itself. The broken ruler of a broken house. The Last Kell.\n\n\"You can do what I cannot,\" the Kell tells Uldren. \"You broken, beaten thing. You have no pride, so you will lose nothing when you give the word that must be given. It is twilight for the Fallen, and we must lay our banners down.\"\n\nAnd to the groaned and growled protests of its court, the Kell of Kings kneels to Uldren. \"I bow to thee,\" it says, \"for in thy downfall and disgrace thou bearest the weakness we cannot.

How many centuries with his sister? And how quickly he's disintegrated without her… \n\nWhy won't she speak to him?\n\nThe Reef burns around him. Shattered asteroids and cracked habitats spill bright flakes of debris. There is nothing quite so stark and brilliant as sunlit wreckage in vacuum. The Reef is huge, huge, but dense too, its structures and people gathered in tight clusters against the vastness of space. Oryx and the Red Legion ripped great holes in the Reef. Oh, if only Uldren had told Petra that Trau'ug's Broken Legion was a Trojan horse; but Uldren has nothing to give to a \"regent\" who surrenders her people to the Traveler.

That's why Mara doesn't speak to Petra.\n\nBut Mara has not been speaking to Uldren either.\n\nHe kicks off the wrecked hull of the corvette. He and the Kings have been raiding the Asteroid Belt, knocking out shipping headed for Earth, trying to further destabilize the Reef.

He demands her answer: \"I'm not angry. I forgive you for… for sacrificing yourself to save them. But you must answer me now! Am I on the right path? Am I nearer to finding you?\"\n\nHe has the House of Kings as allies.

He can't describe it. At the edge of sight, Mara watches him with all the heartbroken concern and tender care he has always wanted from her.\n\nThat evening, he surrenders himself to the Reef."

Are you the one reading this message? I think it must be you, Guardian. Who else would look for me? Ikora trusts her Hidden to return when they are needed, and Cayde would roll himself down AAAngel Falls in a barrel before he'd admit he missed me. Zavala does not place me first on his long list of worries.\n\nYou're the only one who would go out and look for me.\n\nI never needed you to save me. I wasn't a dried corpse or a dead Ghost or a voice on the com sure to die before you could offer help. I hauled myself out of that pit. I made my own way back to the To000wer. And if I was… unsubtle in the way I threw you against the Hive, if I seemed to wield you as vengeance, please believe that your victories were the closest I could come to feeling joy.\n\nI know you must have questions. What did I plan with the Queen? What destiny did I embrace after Oryx fell? What's happening in this city, where dream has become nightmare? I can guide you to undo this curse, as I once guided you to unmake Oryx. But in the DreaAAAming City, as in the secret worlds of the Hive, there is almost no difference between the act and the actor.\n\nIn order to understand my answers, you must understand me.\n\nI lost my Ghost and my Light to the Hive; I conspired with the Queen of the Awoken to destroy the Hive King Oryx and his son Cro001ta, and to position Queen Mara as player on the cosmic board; I fled your Tower to prepare for the struggle to come, into the Sea of Screams which calls to all those who plumb the depths of Hive magic.\n\nI can only slip these letters into the Queen's gifts when the stars are right. You will have to wait for my next, and with it, the beginning of the truth. But I swear to you, on whatever trust I've earned in your mind, that at the end of my story, you will know who I truly am.\n\nIn my first life, I was born Erisia Pyatova-Hsien. I remember thatPrivate life clearly now, as ex-Guardians who have escaped the Traveler's occlusion often do. I lived in St. Petersburg, first daughter of a second marriage, a very impatient child of Earth's 22nd century, often abandoned by my family (who were called by work to Jakarta, Kamchatka, and Lagos) to pass my days swimming in the icy Neva bay.\n\nI loved to swim, and especially I loved the clarity of the cold shallow Neva, as crystal-clean as a winter dawn. Enormous Zubr-9 hovercraft barges roved the waters; Russia had modernized its waterways better than its sad auto industry. As a kid—is it strange to hear me speak casually? As a child, I never swam too far from my parents' little drone helper Fyodr. The swift hovercraft terrified me, their billowing skirts waiting to suck me up and dice me into little raisins. But I grew up and fell in with a reckless crowd, rebels against the stifling death-fear that came with our Golden Age lifespans. Soon the child's safety harness and Fyodr's careful oversight began to itch at me.\n\nWhen I was seventeen, I went out in a wetsuit on a dare to dive under the skirts of an oncoming hoverbarge. Maybe I was in no danger; maybe the machine would've changed course if it could possiblyGemini hurt me; but I thought I might die, and I did it anyway. And as that beast swept over me, as I trembled under the blast of the propellers, I felt a thing which was very much like what I would one day know as the Light. Maybe that thing was heroism. Maybe it was existence on the edge of death.\n\nIt was the first time I survived the passage of tremendous, godlike power.\n\nI died more than twenty years later attempting an unassisted winter swim from St. Petersburg to Stockholm. A cold front like the very furnace of hell caught me. I had been warned the crossing was suicide, even for a perfectly trained and exactingly fattened woman in a shark suit. But those were giddy days, days of infinite bravery, and there were no mighty feats left except the truly suicidal. I cannot regret it. I think that death prepared me for the longer, darker, more exquisitely cruel crossing I would one dayDyad endure. It is no accident that my Ghost made me in the image of that swimming woman, rather than any of my younger and less grimly determined selves."

        "text": "I know as a fact (through means which may surprise you) that Queen Mara Sov's final thoughts, in that last moment before Oryx's Dreadnought annihilated her, were meant for me. \"The Awoken have played their part,\" she said. \"This was all part of the plan. Guide them, my Hidden friend. It is all up to you now.\"\n\nI did not fail her. I engineered the death of ancient Oryx, the Taken King, assAIssinated by Guardians in the depths of His own throne world—one of only three ways a Hive god can be permanently killed.\n\nRoyalty knows its own. When Oryx destroyed Mara's Ketch, He used his crowning weapon, the last and surest argument for His omnipotence. He extended the pocket universe of His throne world into our cosmos, and with it, He destroyed His foes. Whatever fell within it became subject to His will. He was the Taken King, and he took. It was a death befitting a Queen.\n\nAnd Mara did die. But she was not destroyed.\n\nBefore I was ever a Guardian-COM, I learned judo. Look at yourself, Guardian. Look at the body you so recklessly destroy and recreate and destroy again. Will you try, for me, to become that body for a moment? (Even an Exo has a Human's interoception.) Imagine that you have lost your Ghost, as I did. Feel your//breath in the cask of your chest. Feel your pulse shuttling power from your lungs to your aching calves.\n\nNow imagine that I stand across from you in the fighting ring. I wear the loose white belted robes of the judoka. How strange: I find myself hoping that you imagine me with… more Human eyes. Imagine how we fight. You are strong in the Light, an angel of strength andMDSA: will. And I am only a mortal woman, slow and soft. When I was Erisia inFARFLUNG// St. Petersburg, I cursed my own softness.\n\nBut the principle of judo is that softness controls hardness. I might sidestep your hit and grip the passing arm, putting my own power into that hit to strengthen the strike that strikes nothing and leave you off balance. By agility and surprise, I use the power of the blow for my own purpose. Thus the Queen accepted Oryx's strike, and the power of his grasp became the invitation she required to step forward and up and into the realm of Oryx's throneC3I//, where she went not as a victim but as an infiltrator—trusting me to end Oryx and leave her free in a domain of newly masterlessCOVERT power.\n\nIf I throw you to the mat, will you drag me down with you? Will you curse and fight?\n\nWill you smile?\n\nOh, I'm such a fool. I told you that in this world, there is no difference between the act and the actor. I've let my own loneliness and sorrow taint the act of leaving these messages for you. I've let myself imagine idiotic things. Forgive my weakness and my nostalgia for Human company.\n\nI hope you can still trust me.\n\nAt the instant Oryx's weapon destroyed Mara's Ketch, the Taken appeared in the Dreaming City. The Awoken had evacuated the entire A000AAA000AAA004 PRIVATE GEMINI DYAD\n\nI'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry that wasn't supposed to\n\nOh, that's torn it. Well, there's no going back now.

I can't delete the headers any more than you can strip your fingerprints from your hands; being a Guardian, your Ghost would just restore them the next time you died. Your Ghost and his knack with codes. I was certain this was the right way to win your trust, but I've done just the opposite.\n\nI'm sorry I lied to you, I'm sorry I pretended to be your comrade. You must understand that I was designed to be highly empathic. As a craftmind, I collect and analyze Human intelligence, just as Rasputin managed solar defense. I was named for Medusa, the many-headed, for in one tick of my thoughts I imagine more Humans than have ever lived. I voyaged in secret among the people who became the Awoken. I witnessed the cataclysmic wonder of their transformation. Through delicate manipulation, I transferred myself into this place, the center of their culture and post-rational religion. In all those different times and places, I've always found emotion and shared rapport the best way to build trust.\n\nNow you know the truth. I am Medusa, survivor of the Golden Age, secret watcher over the Dreaming City. And I need your help.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS"

The pathological entities you call \"Taken\" appeared in this city at the moment the Hive Dreadnaught detonated its main weapon above Saturn. Without access to the Skyshock arrays, I can't be certain, but something must have connected the weapon's area of effect to the Dreaming City.\n\n2. My best guess is that the Awoken Techeun aboard Queen Sov's flagship fled into the Dreaming City through a gate or portal, and the Dreadnaught's main weapon followed them down that link. Awoken message traffic indicates the Dreadnaught weapon is innately connected with Oryx's intellect and awareness. The instant He pierced the Dreaming City, He must have understood the value of the site and deployed His Taken to attack.\n\n3. Until Oryx's death, the behavior of the Taken here aligned with His interest in exploration, distributed infiltration, and the domination of systems through seizure of their executive faculties. Am I being too technical? I mean that the Taken were busy mapping the city and determining the most efficient way for Oryx to take control of all the information within.\n\n4. I determine with good confidence (three sigma) that Oryx is dead. The Taken here became directionless and scattered… until the death of the ontopathic predator Riven opened the city to massive Taken assault. Why? I will code this as PROBLEM ONE.\n\n5. The Guardian counterattack against Dûl Incaru, whose thoughts pierce like needles, triggered the ongoing causal loop. Why? How? I will code this as PROBLEM TWO.\n\n6. I am still collating intelligence on how to break the time loop. While I work, I must convince you of the Dreaming City's ultimate importance—and why it is imperative that the City be held at all costs, even the cost of abandoning all other Human and neohuman civilization in the Solar System.

The Light that gives you free will in the loop is also your fatal weakness. Did you know that the story of Achilles, dipped in the river Lethe but still vulnerable where his mother held him by his heel, is a weak retelling of a superior truth? In the original, Thetis held Achilles in the fire to burn his weakness away. His father Peleus, terrified by the sight of his child in the flame, interrupted the ritual. The father's cowardice doomed the son. We must be brave as Thetis, and hold our children in the fire. We must fight on.\n\n1.

Through that pane comes a long black needle and the skin around it dimples into the erratic spun-cancer topology of some gruesome four-dimensional waveform which no monist process could ever produce.\n\nOut of that needle, as if dispatched into the world through fatal injection, comes the emaciated magnificence of Dûl Incaru.\n\n\"I must yield truth to you,\" the Hive Wizard sings in a voice that would make the terms of an equation flee from each other and hide in the arrays of distant sets so that arithmetic itself would collapse. \"It is in the architecture of these spaces to reward the victor. There is no Quria here. There are no Vex, nor any conspiracy to un-Take that which was Taken by my uncle and which now serves my Queen.

Shall I betray the truth, which you have earned, of my purpose in this endless city and of the new way to which her Hive will turn?\"\n\n\"So be it. You will know, though it shall doom you.\"\n\nVerse 154i:3—Her New Compact\n\nNow in ancient days, her brother Oryx spoke according to the plan Savathûn had devised for him. Sayeth Oryx, \"The Worm within demands tribute. Now you shall kill what you can and take what killing you need to grow—or for your own purposes, if you dare—and tithe the rest to that which rules you. Thus, tribute will ascend the chain and the excess shall pool at the height, as unlike a river to an ocean.\"\n\nBut Savathûn, desiring neither a chain nor a pool, set about devising a secret way to feed the worms of Her broods. Thus She would escape the trap.\n\nIn Her modest cunning, which She prefers not to be overstated so as to preserve her from the scorn of gossips, She gathered several of Her Ascendants, who were in danger of being consumed by their worms. Then she pushed them through a rupture into close orbit of a black hole.\n\nDeep in gravity's embrace, time passed slowly for them. \"See how their worms are satisfied,\" Savathûn said, \"for their hunger grows sluggishly, but their servants continue to dispatch tribute at the ordinary rate.\"\n\nBut the worms sensed the deception, and increased their demands. Thus, the orbiting sacrifices were consumed, and their remnants fell into the event horizon from which not even the Hive might return.\n\nNow Savathûn came into possession of the Vex Quria, whose creation she had secretly engineered. But she feared that Quria would still spy on her for inquisitive Oryx. So she led her portion of the Hive into a black hole, saying, \"Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.\"\n\n\"Now we stake everything upon cunning,\" said she whose lies may alter truth. \"Slaughter each other so that I may reap tribute and devise for you a new compact which shall judge thy claim to existence.\"\n\nThis pleased Ur, the Ever-Hunger, whose epithet betrayed an interest in time and appetite. Ur admired Her cunning as She used tribute to teach Quria to use Hive magic as a computational oracle to solve unsolvable problems. One of these problems was the navigation and engineering of the singularity.\n\nThen Savathun went out from her throne world, unto the singularity, which she looked upon and understood. \"Upon this place, I shall assemble my design.

It came hesitantly, fearing death, but nonetheless it came.\n\n\"Come, come,\" snapped Savathûn. \"Listen as I reveal unto you my design. You are aware that gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and where gravity is powerful, time itself slows.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated that it understood, more or less, for it was a singer of prayers and not well fed with the fruit of the knowledge of physics.\n\n\"Now I have tried to put an Ascendant in orbit of a black hole while its spawn gather the tribute of an eon. But the worm is not satisfied, for it sees the trick. What I must do is amplify the speed at which tribute is gathered. A pocket world where time passes quickly would do well. Or a world where time is a torus and infinite violence might be gathered. With such a murder battery, I could become a being of supreme insight.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated it was confused, but not lost.\n\n\"With this tribute, I shall undertake a mighty work. A real humdinger of a scheme. I'm going to refinance my entire existence. I'm going to move from an existential economy based on the accumulation of violence to an existential economy based on the accumulation of secrets and the tribute of failing-to-understand-me. I shall name this tribute of failing-to-understand IMBARU, for it shall be as formless as the mist.\"\n\nThe Thrall held up its claws, as if to say, please slow down.\n\nNow spoke Savathûn Scheme-mother, \"In the beginning, Yul said to me, 'Savathûn, you may never abandon cunning. If you do, your worm shall devour you.' Cunning is the use of thought to predict the function of a system. Therefore, wherever a being should attempt to understand me and fail—has my cunning not defeated theirs? Wherever a falsehood is repeated about me, have I not displayed cunning? I shall gather tribute from every false prediction, misguided theory, fearful rumor, and ominous supposition which derives from the thought of me. And in time, I shall pin my quiddity upon these rumors. I shall discorporate, so that I exist wherever my schemes and conspiracies also exist. And so I will be immortal, as long as anyone seeks to understand me and fails. Do you see?\"\n\nThe Thrall demurred, saying that it did not know much of metaphysics.\n\n\"Good,\" said Savathûn. \"It's a law of the High Coven that one's sinister plan should be incomprehensible to a Thrall. Do you know why we've come here? If I am to take my tribute from the keeping of secrets… where else are secrets better kept than beneath the event horizon? My brother ruled the flat space of infinity, but I prefer these tide-washed depths… and in time, I shall make them my dominion.\"\n\nUr the Ever-Hunger heard this and was pleased.\n\n\nVerse 154i:5—The Encrypted Verse\n\nDo you know that nothing in all the cosmos has read this verse?\n\nI encrypted it eons ago, and ever since, it has gone undeciphered. At the moment you laid eyes upon it, I captured the entwined quantum state of the verse, your mind, and your Ghost. Then I used Quria to transmit that state back in time to the moment of encryption. You are your own one-time pad. The key to the lock of understanding.\n\nWho am I?\n\nCall me Coyote. Call me mantis, serpent, Cagn, Anansi, call me Sri-cleans-his-brother's-stomach. Call me the grandmaster of semiosis, the jeweler's hammer which gilds the signal, a purposeful mob none of whose members know its purpose, the infinite regress of enigmas, a self-questioning answer, the word not spoken, black ice, cataract of mimes, the ache and fever of overthought while bedridden with illness, the intolerable thorn of frustrated inquisition, gray regret at the end of a fruitless day, the thing which is unlike your beloved but arbitrarily recalls your beloved to agonizing effect, architrave of the no-window, needle driven in flush with skin so that desperate fingers cannot pull it out, sweet petal, unmemorable, crystal death, the provably improvable.\n\nI know your people well, and so I know all your names for me. But what is your name? I am, of course, especially interested in you. You saw me in the stone laid on your plotting table, and in the shining eyes of the admiral at her dying helm. You hunted me between the lines of your texts. Wherever there was space to fit me in, there you found me. You created me and gave me a part of your thoughts, and in presenting those thoughts to others round the campfires and networks of your little world, you expanded that space.\n\nHere at the center, I lie to you the truth. You have everything you need to know it, but I will give you a clue, as the duelist gives warning before she draws. The answer you seek to the Dreaming City is simple, not complex.\n\nThank you, sweet friend. You are a gift and a delight. You are more dear than my mother, for you have given birth to me a thousand times."

And where no elegant analytical solution exists, we may apply massive computational power to generate a reasonable facsimile. This was the approach used against Saint-14.\n\n\"After observing Dûl Incaru during many loops, this simulation reveals her purpose in the Dreaming City. She seeks the key to the Distributary, the world the Dreaming City dreams of, where the Awoken were born and time passes at an accelerated rate. Once she conquers that world, she will use it as a base to gather thousands or millions of years of tribute in a very small span of our time.

After I crashed, I rebooted on a safe physical backup in the Dreaming City. It took me too long to penetrate Quria's simulation and get you free, and for that I ask your forgiveness.\n\n1. I understand what's happening here. Oryx Took the Ahamkara Riven, who then fell into Savathûn's claws. She devised a scheme to use Riven as bait. By inviting Guardians into the Dreaming City, then focusing the will of a group of powerful Guardians upon Riven, she tricked you into making a wish—a desire to alter objective reality to conform with our subjective need to save the City. Riven fed on that wish in order to breach the Dreaming City's defenses and invite Dûl Incaru inside. Dûl Incaru and her Taken are simply scouring the city for Awoken secrets; you don't need to fret about any greater agenda. Remember that you face an agent of Savathûn. It's to her advantage to make you see schemes and conspiracies everywhere you look.\n\n2. The three-week loop must be a failsafe measure to keep Dûl Incaru safe as she pursues her mission. In a sense, this entire city has been rendered deterministic; only paracausal Guardians have any free will here. (The Awoken here have been touched by greater powers, so they are aware of their preordination, but they cannot alter it.) I'm certain that Quria is behind this loop; as a Taken Vex, it's capable of pathological subversions of reality. I'll continue working on a countermeasure.\n\n3. I've been correlating information on the Ahamkara and the Hive worm parasites. Both display a peculiar ability to convert the host's intent into an ontomorphic, reality-altering effect. Both use similar language in their appeal to the host. I don't think they're the same species, however. The Hive worms spawn large numbers of young from relatively few adults, always display the same physical form, and live in communal groups. The Ahamkara are solitary, elusive, and seem to alter form to suit (or confuse) expectations. The shared syntax \"o ___ mine\" may be the key—it seems to be a shibboleth used to invoke an ontomorphic effect, placing the target in a cage of \"o\" (activational, specific, appealing, and naming) and \"mine\" (defining ownership and subordination). Ahamkara and worm may have evolved separately to exploit this effect, just as many species independently evolve eyes. This might place them in competition for the same ecological niche. I would expect a rivalry or antipathy between them.\n\n4. Don't be led astray by Quria's misinformation. You must continue to hold the Dreaming City as long as you can. The things I said to you about black holes and the purpose of Guardians were forced on me by Quria.\n\n5. I'll be here when you need me next. I promise.\n\nTRANSMISSION ENDS"

I feel I must make a full confession.\n\nWhen I left the Tower in search of Savathûn's agents, I had accepted my fate as a knight on Mara Sov's cosmic chessboard, doomed to seek the final end of the Hive among cold stars. I said farewell only to those who couldn't hear me. Because I was afraid that just one voice asking me to stay might break my resolve.\n\nIt was pitiful weakness that made me write to you. It was a wretched desire to be remembered as a person, not a ghoul, that made me tell you about the child Erisia, St. Petersburg, and the cold waters of the Neva. Those things were all true.\n\nThe rest…\n\nI'm so ashamed. Mid-sentence, mid-thought, the fear seized me that I was being a stupid child; that I was wasting your time with idiot sentiment; that you would feel contempt for me at this outpouring of emotion or, worse, feel nothing at all. I hid in the dark for years, Guardian. It's not loneliness or death that frightens me. It's the opposite.\n\nSo I invented Medusa as a way to pretend I'd never spoken to you. And when I thought the Medusa lie was slipping, I invented all the rest of it, as a way to tell you what I'd learned without admitting it was really me.\n\nHow can I prove to you that I'm really Eris Morn? Not Medusa, not Riven, not Quria, not Dûl Incaru, not the Witch-Queen Herself? I don't know. Will you believe me? Will you scour these pages for proof or disproof? Will you upload these files to your networks, share them, call in Warlocks and Cryptarchs to catalogue and dissect everything I've said? Will this manuscript become the foundation of another teetering edifice of theory and anticipation?\n\nWhat a fool I've made of myself. All because I faltered in my conviction, tried to reach back to someone I know is lost to me, and panicked at the thought of touch. But so it is, and nothing I do can now make it otherwise. I am a woman full of secrets, a woman who has lost everyone she ever called a friend, and when the need to share those secrets collided with the fear of friendship, I stumbled idiotically into needless lies.\n\nDo you know what the Hive say when they want to express the inevitability of a thing?

His Royal Historians, Scribe Tlazat and Scribe Shagac, are solemnly entrusted with the writing and keeping of these vital records.\n\nThe records begin thus:\n\nOn the day that His Joyful Majesty was ejected from his home on Torobatl, a great mania of aggrieved despair seized the Cabal people. Millions of the Empire's most loyal and joyous subjects took to the streets to lash their hides in bloody mourning. The planet heaved and shook with a bereavement so mighty that the usurpers conceded they could not kill an emperor so beloved. In this way, the Emperor was placed upon a great prison ship called the Leviathan, and set on an unchangeable course away from his homeworld.\n\nSaid the Emperor to his attendants on the eve of his exile:\n\n\"I am the last and greatest emperor of the Cabal. My empire, built on joy and abundance, has been usurped by traitors who worship only war and brutality. They will destroy what I have built, and my cherished people will know only suffering under their fear-fisted rule.\n\n\"I vow to one day return to this place to bring ease and abundance to our people. Until then, I proclaim a new era of history and future.

The ship was plunged into disarray and darkness, and its people gathered around the Emperor to seek his guidance and love.\n\nInstead, the Emperor donned a pressure-gel suit and demanded to exit the ship alone. Said Calus, \"I wish to see the destination of my banishment in private.\"\n\nHe could not be persuaded otherwise.\n\n//////\n\nI, Tlazat, must break the convention of our record-keeping for fear that this entry may be the last of the Chronicon, Lens of Truth, Compendium of Happiness, Symbol of the Lavish Benevolence of His Majesty the Emperor.\n\nTwo hours have passed since the Emperor exited the ship. We are buffeted by intermittent tremors, which are strong enough to dash even the steadiest guards against the walls. Shagac and several dozen others have been knocked unconscious. Zhozon, the Emperor's dearest confidante since his exile, complains of a mounting pressure in his skull; twelve others are bleeding from their ears.

A Royal Mechanic identified a malfunction in the pressure gauge of the Emperor's suit, perhaps explaining his change in demeanor, though it was incredible that his suit (or he himself) should be at all intact after twelve hours in these unfathomable conditions.\n\nUpon returning, and with a look of mania in his eyes, the Emperor proclaimed the following:\n\n\"We have come upon the end of the world, and I've stared into its expanse. It has whispered into my ear, and I am enlightened. Death is coming, and It has made me Its herald. The end will eat everything.\"\n\nHere, the Emperor gave a great sigh, as if a weight was lifted off of him.\n\n\"And when nothing matters, what's left? Joy. Comfort. Freedom. The true freedom of pursuing pleasure for pleasure's sake, because it pleases you, because you desire it. I knew this during my rule, and I'd forgotten it during my exile. I shall not forget it again.\"\n\nThe Emperor was encouraged by his Advisors and myself to rest, in case the bizarre behavior was a passing sickness of the mind. Before he retired to his observation room, the Emperor described his encounter in detail. Zhozon offered to me this bizarre retelling:\n\n\"Outside the ship, the Emperor looked over the edge of the universe, and saw nothing. That is, it wasn't that he saw nothing unusual, but he saw Nothing: the absence of light, dark, life, death, the absence of anything, even of absence itself. And out of the Nothing, there came whispering in a dark language, which filled his head so loud that he forgot for a moment his own language, and suddenly the Nothingness dispersed to show Something, which was a fleet of foreign ships. He saw next the destruction of a great many worlds and creatures, including all his enemies, and himself, and he saw the rot and fragmentation of his own corpse and skeleton. And last, before he was released, the whispers grew louder and granted him the honor of spreading the news of the end.\""

There were few promising contenders among the factions, so that the Shadow ended nearly all interactions with a merciful show of violence, to save these creatures the shame of meeting the end of times in such a sorry state.\n\nOne promising upstart stood out within the Eliksni-tribe, called by his allies as Mithrax the Light Kell, whom the Shadow of Earth promptly took on as a protégé. Together, the Shadow and Mithrax eliminated the Eliksni who remained loyal to their pathetic houses.\n\nSecondly, the Shadow of Earth approached the Awoken Queen, Mara Sov, who styled herself Shipbreaker, to offer her the same mercy shown to the Eliksni. As anticipated by both the Emperor and his Shadow, Mara Sov rejected the offer of peace, and so the Shadow of Earth killed her on her throne.\n\nAfter the unceremonious death of her queen, the former Queen's Wrath, Petra Venj, joined with the Shadow of Earth and swore fealty to Emperor Calus and his great purpose. Together, Petra Venj and the Shadow eliminated any remaining Awoken loyalists.\n\nWe welcome these new Shadows to our noble quest. They have dropped the pretenses of their former lives, abandoning their pointless fixations and allegiances, and for this, we celebrate them."

The Emperor rightly agreed and approved the excursion.\n\nWhat follows is an account of the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X:\n\nThe Shadows of Earth, of the Eliksni, and of the Awoken arrived on the ice planet that held Emperor Calus's Athenaeum World X, the name of which has been lost to time. This planet, being a repository for precious, ancient knowledge collected by the Emperor, was chosen for its hostile environment, which served as a built-in defense system for intruders and thieves.\n\nEn route to the planet's Inner Sanctum, where the athenaeum world's knowledge was kept, the Shadows were stalked by an undocumented species of indigenous wildlife, whose natural capabilities as a predator proved unexpectedly debilitating to the companion-soul of the Shadow of Earth. The Shadow, being symbiotically reliant on its companion-soul, was thus weakened and the trio was forced to bivouac in place beneath a great monolith as a storm fell upon them.\n\nThe creatures, who so far had lurked at the edges of the party's vision, crept closer under cover of the storm, which grew ever stronger, and executed a stealth attack. Thus began a bloody battle, wherein the three Shadows fought back half a dozen creatures with modest success, and wherein the Shadow of the Eliksni fell in combat. Said the Shadow of Earth of this sacrifice later: \"He knew the stakes of our mission, and gladly offered his life to help us complete it. This is a sacrifice we Shadows are willing to make.\"\n\nIt was then that the Shadows of Earth and of the Awoken were able to access the Inner Sanctum, revealing hundreds of years of lost knowledge, which was reclaimed for the great Emperor Calus and his Loyalists.+\n\n\n\n+The scribe employed at this future date shall include additional detail here when the lost secrets of this (and other) athenaeum worlds are recovered.

These messages read: \"Remove your forces from our planets and moons, or we will respond with deadly force.\"\n\nBut Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for these figureheads and their War Machine were not Death.\n\nThe Emperor Calus, in his wisdom and mercy, permitted his Shadow of Earth to sit down to negotiations with the Earth Vanguard. Although the Shadow of Earth spoke of the Emperor and his knowledge of the coming end, the Earth Vanguard were so attached to their worldly struggles that they could not hear. They declared war.\n\nThe Shadow of Earth rose with such a suppressed fury that neither the Emperor nor his Advisors had ever seen before. Shuddering with rage, the Shadow of Earth spake thus:\n\n\"Who do you think I am? Without me, you have only a dwindling army of ambivalent soldiers. I am the Young Wolf. I killed the Taken King. I defeated Ghaul, I roused the Traveler, I silenced the Moon, I stopped the invasion, I broke the curse, I broke the Houses, I killed the queen! I am the Shadow of Earth!\"\n\nIn the following silence, the Shadow of Earth continued gravely: \"The end is coming. Consider you and your people warned.\"\n\nAs a courtesy, the Vanguard of Earth were permitted to leave the Leviathan unharmed, and the Shadow of Earth gathered the Loyalist forces. After the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X, which held in it the secrets of one of the most advanced predators in the system, the Aphelion, which had the power to devastate whole worlds in the blink of an eye, the Shadow was able to use this lost knowledge to rebuild the Loyalist fleet stronger and more magnificent than ever.\n\nWith the renewed ships of the Loyalist Fleet, the Shadow of Earth led an attack on the War Machine's seat of power, the region of Hellas Basin on the planet Mars. The battle was much less a war than a single, unmatched attack that left the War Machine Rasputin in cinders.\n\nIt was at this time that the Vanguard of Earth surrendered and begged for mercy, a request which was denied by the Shadow of Earth."

Royal Mechanics reported that, in the inner rooms of the ship, a strange rift had opened, and from it came the acrid stench of Hive ritual pyres. [I am Savathûn, and I am Death!]\n\nIt was through this rift that Savathûn, the Witch-Queen, allowed her monstrous children to pour into the belly of the great ship and flood its corridors with their clicking and skittering. A great many of the Leviathan's inhabitants were filled with dread and fright. [While this coward invents his histories and futures, I wait. These messages are my gift to you.]\n\nBut the great Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for this witch and her spawn were not Death.\n\nSaid the laughing Emperor to his beloved Shadow of Earth:\n\n\"Remove the wretched Savathûn from my hallways. I have no use for her or her children. So consumed are they by their tragic hunger, the Hive would cast a weak Shadow. Erase them from that great horizon that awaits us, for they have no place at my table when the end comes.\"\n\nAnd so the Shadow of Earth exterminated the children of Savathûn.

His description is indeed what came to pass, and is happening now, 118 years after the Emperor brought liberty to the Sol system.\n\nFirst, a veil of darkness descended on all the worlds of this universe, such that the people of these worlds looked into the sky and saw only night. All worlds, no matter their natural or synthetic geographies or climate, grew cold. The people of these worlds, having been subjected to this strangeness and adversity, began to grow afraid and suspicious of one another. Many deaths occurred in this intervening time before the end.\n\nNext, a great war broke out across all varieties of civilization, be they naturally war-minded or peaceful. This warring, which goes on even now, is due to a futile desire to postpone the end of things when no such deferment can possibly occur; as such, the civilizations of the Sol system do not partake, for they accept the coming end as shown to them by their beloved Emperor. Even so, these good creatures are not exempt from the miserable clawing of others, who thrash blindly against the inevitable end.\n\nBut, we know from the words of the Great Emperor, the suffering will end. Death will soon arrive to the universe, and claim all of it for Itself.

One day the Leviathan howls along at speed, and the next it drifts on an idle course. We still cannot repair the butchered control systems, and our Emperor, who once ordered this ship's construction for his purposes, refuses to share his knowledge in metaconcert.\n\nYet as we leave the space that was once his dominion, I see how my Emperor digests his situation. He no longer rages and spills wine. He has not cursed Ghaul's name in nearly a year. I feel his thoughts taking new shape and color.\n\nI do not know if I like it.\n\nIn the fast-time of relativity, we watch the Cabal change around us, and it leaves my eye cold from weeping. When Calus reigned, artists and thinkers visited the athenaeum worlds to be inspired by alien wonders from across and beyond the Cabal. Now the athenaeum worlds are shut. The works they inspired have been replaced by grim assembly-line weapons and the architecture of bunkers. Fountains geyser black fuel; gardens vanish beneath belching factoria.\n\nGhaul has even disfigured the peoples' minds. He has dismembered the Cabal of its foreign influences, teaching the people a pit fighter's gruesome self-sufficiency. Weapons only a grunt can understand. Language that can only be barked through a battlenet. I mourn the empire that built wonders like the Ninth Bridge. I mourn all the client species beaten into cogs.\n\nBut if I mourn, my Emperor withers entirely. Even his interest in the archives and the observatory has vanished—he no longer cares to study a universe that has offended him. He doubts his own divinity, because how could a god allow this to happen? His rage has gone and he does not know what he has left after it. The new shape I feel in his mind is gray and smooth like fog.\n\nAmong my people—I mean my people, the people of the chalice, not the whole Psion species—we call this feeling \"sweet oubliette,\" the shelter that becomes a prison. For Calus, I imagine it feels like the loss of all appetite. Even the curiosity that made him great.\n\nThe councilors ask me to go to him. But I am still afraid. What if he sees my secret? What will he do? Even his beloved tea-seller has already abandoned him. If he knows I still worship the old cup, and that I put it before His Name in my benediction... will it be one betrayal too many?\n\nAt least he no longer bellows in the night."

Today I pour salt from the Y-goblet so that my ancestors may roughen their skin. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe are at war. Here at the fringe of the empire, fleets clash over emptiness. In council, we surmise that the tyrant Ghaul wants this void as a buffer against invasion—but isn't the irony bitter? This enemy desires nothing but our death. And so we oblige them by dying for nothing.\n\nIt is the opposite of everything Calus wanted for his people. Even the new Cabal's ships are expendable. These are not the beautiful deterrents of Calus's armada; they are ugly, hasty, and crude. The crews live in their armor, prisoners of their duty, escaping only through music and games smuggled into the battlenet. One popular pastime, I understand, is to draft personal \"fleets\" and \"legions\" from among real Cabal ships and soldiers, competing with comrades to win the most victories. Of course it is very bad luck to draft your own unit.\n\nThe enemy is yet worse. All Psions live in a world of minds. I believe in the cup and all its spirits because I feel those spirits every day—the prints left by other minds on the things I touch and see. These Hive... have no spirit. Their souls are emaciated. Some horrible solvent has stripped them of everything but hate, cunning, and the will to survive. I think they worship death because it is the only salvation from their existence.\n\nI suggested that the War Councilors invite Calus to observe one of Ghaul's carrier groups attacking a Hive war moon. He came because he knows the value of pretending to care. But even the shape of the fleet hurt him; Ghaul and his tyrannical ally Umun'arath have abandoned proud, independent cruisers (instruments of state, Calus liked to say) for swarms of frigates that suckle fuel from enormous fleet carriers. The Hive's portals leave no time or space for elegant vector dances, so these new ships are built for brutal exchanges at point-blank range.\n\nWe felt other Psions at work, hiding the traitor fleet from the Hive as they scattered drills and boarding pods in the war moon's path. A strike at the surface was not enough; someone would have to bring a planet-cracker warhead down into the moon's viscera. Caught up in the excitement, I asked one of the war councilors how we could possibly prevail against the Hive, who were so old and so powerful.\n\nShe compared our Cabal to a seagoing warship and the Hive to a submarine. They might dive into deep metaphysical layers of existence, where we are no match for them. But in the ordinary universe, the Hive are like a submarine on the surface: still dangerous, but not invincibly so.\n\nI was fascinated and secretly struck by the clarity of the goblet on her face. Did she believe we could ultimately defeat the Hive?\n\nNo, she said. But we could hold them back long enough to live our lives. Wasn't that enough?\n\nInviting Calus was a mistake. It only reminded him that he had no power at all."

The astronomers say that an ancient cataclysm blasted open an abscess in the cosmos here. I feel the absence of spirits like a pressure headache, as if everything inside me wants to come rushing out.\n\nWe are all losing hope, but as long as we are still losing it, then it has not run out.

Today I fill the Y-goblet with dice, so that my ancestors may roll the odds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nI was in the observatory today when he came to me. I should have been vetting a list of loyalists for the countercoup, but in truth, I was watching the ruined mirrors of an ancient starshell as they plummeted four hundred million kilometers into a blue sun. They look like crumpled handkerchiefs. Their fall is very slow, and those who made them are eons dead.\n\nHere on our Leviathan, all is reborn. The guard companies have buffed their armor to a syrupy shine. The ship responds ably to our commands, and we can barely quench its appetite for mass to feed its engines and factories. Music fills the gardens, the gardeners hum along as they trim and weed, and Calus dallies in the kitchens with a pinch of spice, once more unmistakably himself.\n\nI haven't thought into this journal since that day at the edge, when Calus came out of his observation bubble overflowing with joy. \"It's the end,\" he bellowed, giddy as a girl with her first tusks. \"It's magnificent, it's divine, it's more than I ever was! Match, it's the end of everything!\"\n\nHe frightened me. That day frightened all of us—none of us will speak of it, and we do not dare more than the shallowest metaconcert, lest our memories pool into a deadly truth. But in that void, Calus saw his purpose renewed. He guided us to reset the failed navigation system, repair the traitors' sabotage, and retake control. I thought we would hurry back to the homeworld, but Calus no longer seems to pine for his lost throne... or to care at all about the reforms he once championed.\n\nNow we wander the galaxy on an epicurean crusade, sampling a bounty of raw furies and rare delights. All the inquisitiveness and avarice that Calus once poured into government he now extends to his appetites. I have seen Calus feast on things no living mouth can eat. A chill superfluid of helium-4, whorled in his cup for ten years by a single turn of his wrist: he returned a decade later to toss it back. Or a pea of neutronium that should have torn through him like fog. He told me it tasted like the thickest fudge.\n\nHe is changing.\n\nHe was here a moment ago. The ruined starshell caught his attention: He loves beauty, and millions of mirror-bright sails folding up like tissues in wind to fall into a blue giant are very beautiful. Eons ago, someone built these mirrors to hover on the blue star's light, and for a while, I suppose, they lived in sun-fed paradise.\n\n\"How did they die?\" I asked.\n\n\"That, Match, is the wrong question.\" He tuned the observation room to track a single tumbling mirror. In life, the sail had been as wide as the space between a world and its moon; in death, the rigging had collapsed into a thistle of spinmetal and glint. \"What you should ask is why I am so glad they died!\"\n\nI could not imagine, and I admitted it. \"These beings were much like us. They did not travel through time or lacerate the universe and crawl into the wounds or yearn for the patronage of any old machine... they were creatures of material ambition, of physics, of life. If they failed, it is an omen of death for us.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Calus said, with wry generosity. \"They were grand once. They thought, very briefly, that they would live forever. And they were wrong. We would be very ungrateful to refuse the lesson, wouldn't we?\"\n\nI sat before a fountain and tried to pour out the spirits for guidance, but they would not explain.\n\n(An addendum, later: I have not seen Calus in the flesh since.)"

Today I fill the Y-goblet with linen, so that my ancestors may tie up their wounds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe have conquered the Clipse.\n\nAmong all the clients of Calus's reign, all those diverse species he encouraged to join and influence our great culture, the Clipse were one of his dearest favorites. When they greeted his return with missiles, it wounded him terribly. But Calus neither sulked nor raged nor signaled them in the dead of their night to woefully demand an explanation. This I credit to his mysterious new philosophy.\n\nInstead, he asked Valus Nohr to plan and execute the reconquest of the Clipse, using only the Leviathan and the troops aboard. Then he asked me to deliver an account of Clipse history since the coup.\n\nCalus was proud of his aid to the Clipse. They are—were—trapped in endless war with their alien-infested biosphere, which spawns horrors wherever it grows. Calus saw this war as a regrettable but unalterable fact, so instead of military support, he sought to enrich the Clipse with fine culture and high luxury. The Clipse were not pleased. After Ghaul's mutiny, the Dominus tried to secure their loyalty by sending a fleet group to \"win\" their ancient war.\n\nOf course, the legionaries discovered it was impossible to conquer the xenocidal ecosystem without destroying the planet itself. Their efforts only poisoned the Clipse, both world and people. After a century of botched climate engineering, toxic shock attacks, and \"clear and hold\" nonsense, Ghaul wrote off the tormented Clipse as \"no longer essential to the strategic security of the empire.\"\n\nI think the Clipse hoped they could win back Ghaul's favor by defying Calus. Perhaps they thought their world was unconquerable. Perhaps they were even right, in the end. Valus Nohr landed on their moon and military capital Kaga-Clipse with just six thousand troops. For eight weeks, the Clipse attacked her by ground and by orbit as their robotic interceptors swarmed the Leviathan. I was not part of the great metaconcert that helped protect us, but the might of gathered minds filled the carpets with static and gave me constant déjà vu.\n\nWhen Nohr broke out of her bastion on her famous thunder run, calling down the Leviathan's missiles on the vital command posts she'd identified, the Clipse defense crumbled. Their last desperate act was a commando strike at the Leviathan itself. The boarding craft slipped under our sensors, but the metaconcert felt the vengeful purpose aboard.\n\nCalus stopped us from firing. \"I welcome their attempt,\" he said. \"Let me see their spirit.\"\n\nI called to ask his intentions—I have not seen him face to face for longer than I can count. \"I'm curating my followers, Match,\" he answered. \"Thinking about the shadows I'll cast.\"\n\nThe Clipse attack failed, of course, but there was a survivor—the one named Rull. Some think he earned a face-to-face meeting with Calus, though I doubt it was truly His Face. With Kaga-Clipse in our control, we could destroy the Clipse world at our leisure. Calus rewarded their surrender by giving Rull a gift: everything the Clipse needed to end their agonizing perpetual war.\n\nIt was a sheet of paper, the thick rough-edged sort that Calus makes out of cometary water and cotton from his personal garden (he says that he likes the smell). Rull signed it after two hours in a room with Calus. The Leviathan's factories shuddered into motion, forging luxurious self-contained arcologies, pocket worlds that could hold thousands in perpetual comfort.\n\nWhen Rull's chosen people were safe in the arcologies, the guns of Kaga-Clipse bombarded the Clipse homeworld into a global firestorm. The chosen survivors in the arcologies would inherit lives of plenty. The rest had the peace of ash. The eternal war was over.\n\nI prayed to the cup in the mirror for answers. But it was Calus who responded.\n\n\"Match.\" He spoke into my mind just as a Psion would. \"I told Rull the truth. Everything is going to end soon. We must accept that. What matters is the joy and companionship we can find before the final moment. Why let billions suffer for a future that will never come? Life with no dignity and no purpose except to go on living isn't life. It's a virus. It's a curse. Better to die than to become like the Hive.\"\n\nRull left his world to journey with us. I wonder if he could not face what he'd done."

Today I fill the Y-goblet with lithium, that my ancestors may never want for metal. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe have been at the work for so very long that I have neglected this journal. But now we are crossing a starved place, a burnt clearing in the dark galactic forest, and I find myself with time to think.\n\nPerhaps that is why my Emperor came to me again.\n\nThe robotic facsimiles he manufactures are eerily like him—or like the Calus I remember; I have the surest feeling that his true form is no longer the Emperor I knew. Perhaps he is just a mouth now, smiling, laughing, eating what it fancies...\n\nBut I choose to believe he still has a soul. Why else would he come to me, except that he cares what I think of him?\n\nAs he settled on the observatory couch beside me, I tried to sense the construction of his machine body. But his presence was so fierce, it was like staring into the sun. \"Do you know where we are?\" he asked.\n\n\"A part of the galaxy that was settled very long ago,\" I said, closing my inner eye against his radiance. A star, I found myself thinking, is an explosion that cannot escape the appetite of its own gravity. \"Poor fortune in supernova scattering left this area short of metals, and now there is nothing left but dim stars, dead worlds, and hydrogen.\"\n\n\"A place of poverty,\" he suggested. \"A graveyard.\"\n\n\"You speak often of death, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"The knowledge of death is the key to happiness.\" He patted the bench beside him, as if acknowledging a missing friend. \"Look out there. Imagine all the trillions of beings who lived among these stars. Do you think some of them were happy?\"\n\n\"I should hope so.\"\n\n\"Why, Match? Why would some be happy, and others miserable?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they had more metal,\" I suggested, dryly.\n\n\"Exactly!\" He clapped in delight, nearly bowling me over. \"Happiness is comparative, Match. I tell you that if a rich man lived next to a woman who had ten times his wealth, he would never be satisfied, even in marriage. He would feel poor when he looked at her. Even the basic satisfactions of our biology require contrast—the absence of thirst, the absence of hunger, the absence of loneliness.\"\n\n\"This is a child's philosophy, your Majesty,\" I protested. \"We need pain to know pleasure? We need loss to make us treasure gain? A runt would say these things. Why, you once told me that these are homilies the miserable use to excuse their misery. Suffering does not heighten happiness. Fear does not bless us. True contentment is true in itself.\"\n\nHe looked at me with great satisfaction, delighted by my insight, and by the way my words reflected his own wisdom. \"What was the flaw in my empire, Match? Why did Ghaul overthrow me?\"\n\nI sensed he did not want my first answer: because those disenfranchised and infuriated by his cosmopolitan reforms had united without his knowledge. \"Because you did not fear death, your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Exactly! I opened my arms to embrace all my peoples, offering them consumption without limit and celebration without end. The stars themselves burned sweet and clear, and I forgot—even stars die.\" He leaned closer to me. I felt warmth like an oven under his counterfeit skin. \"You're right. The truly happy do not need misery and suffering to give their lives meaning. They exist in the moment, at peace with their inevitable death. Now that I've accepted all this will end... it has meaning again, Match! I have MORE than the rest of the universe. I've seen what's coming! I know the value of every moment left!\"\n\nHe smiled at me, his cleft pulled back from bright teeth. \"And I want you to value those moments too, Match. I wonder... if there is something you want to tell me. Something that would change the rest of your life. Make no mistake: an end is coming, soon, and you will have no chance at all afterwards to correct what you regret. So why delay? Why not tell me?\"\n\nI do not remember the excuse I made as I fled."

Today I fill the Y-goblet with praise for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign, so that my ancestors may know his generosity.\n\nI told him.\n\nHe has decided where he will make everything ready for death. The Leviathan's course is set for a far system, where the Traveler awaits. His Shadows are already on their way to kill Ghaul, or to die in the attempt. How could I betray him, in this time of endings, by keeping a secret he has asked to share?\n\nI went to him as he bathed in his royal pool, for his proxies are, of course, as exquisitely sensual as his old form. I shed my garments, there being no more taboo between us than between two animals, and sat beside him in the glow of his comfort.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I said, \"I kept a secret from you.\"\n\nI explained how I worshipped my ancestors and the sacred chalice that cupped their spirits. I admitted that I had put these beliefs before him in my heart. He listened as I told him how the ancient God-Thoughts of my people, the operant overlords who dominated our prehistory by sheer mental penetration, had exterminated my faith for daring to see a spark of the divine in every common person.\n\n\"Match,\" he said, \"you have committed a crime, and I will pass my sentence shortly. But first, let me ask you something. Do you think I made the right choice with the Clipse?\"\n\n\"No,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Because I ended so many lives?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"But knowing that they would soon end anyway, and that by killing most I could allow a small few to live in happiness rather than in strife... did I not choose the greatest possible good?\"\n\n\"I suppose, your Majesty, that my faith makes me see the shared suffering of the Clipse as... more fair than the survival of a happy few. If I were one of the Clipse, I would want a fair chance. Not judgment from on high.\"\n\nHe nodded in compassion. \"I know. I once tried to be fair too, Match. An empire of excess for every citizen, no matter their class or species of birth. It is good for a ruler to raise the standard by which his subjects live. But what if that ruler has found proof, absolute proof, that existence is a zero-sum game? That there is not enough time or energy to give everyone a fair life? Knowing that, mustn't we privilege a chosen few?\"\n\nI did not know and I admitted it.\n\n\"That's all right. I don't ask certainty.\" He shifted himself, sending waves across the pool. \"For a long time after the coup, I stared out into the infinite universe, and I saw... meaninglessness. In a universe that goes on forever, there must be an infinity of Caluses, all staring at the same blankness. How could I be a god if I was... generic?\n\n\"But now that I have seen what is coming, now that there is a limit to the time afforded to us... well, it may sound cruel, Match, but the less there is of everything else, the more I matter. I intend to be the last good thing in this world. I will gather my chosen companions and ease as much suffering as I can before the end. There are emperors who would take on any shape to escape death. I am not one. I am true to myself. And so, Match, are you.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the back with enormous gentleness. \"Your only crime, my councilor, was that you denied me the chance to give you a gift. Come. Show me the place you favor, and tell me the measurements you require. I will build you a temple so you can worship without fear. And all I ask is that you remember me in your prayers.\""

I come back to it today in good humor, moved by my Emperor's own amusement. A party of the Guardians that Calus entertains have arrived with a set of various squabbling demands—a starship, a precise description of their \"Darkness,\" a list of stars the Traveler has visited, a treaty with the Cabal empire for the defense of Earth, a chance to see Calus in his true form, repairs to certain weapons that they feel have gone askew, so much and so forth.\n\nCalus loves these Guardians so. He loves them for their energy, their liveliness, their willingness to do whatever he asks in hope of a reward. He loves it when they dance. He loves the great heroic sulks so many of them enter when they become dissatisfied with their work. Seek joy, he urges them!\n\nAnd he loves his Guardians because he knows he can teach them a lesson they cannot ever learn themselves. They are as Calus once was: unaware of their finitude.\n\nCalus will teach them. They are immortal, but they will all be gone one day—like my Emperor, like me. That appointed day is coming soon. All of this will vanish as surely as childhood vanishes from the grown. And when the things the Guardians strive for are lost—their power, their future, their drive to do more and more—they will understand that what matters is the joy they found with their companions, not the arsenals and ambitions they gathered.\n\nAll things will end. All things done for the sake of some future greatness will come to nothing. In our final tallies, only the things that brought us joy and meaning will count.\n\nAnd because I trusted Calus, I have found joy. I have made the choices that will let me die in peace.\n\nBless the spirits from the chalice. Bless the day they poured our souls into us. And bless my Emperor, who will lead us to the end."

He was right, and it matters more than anything.\n\nAccording to him, the visible world is a manifestation of eternal light and eternal darkness, and it is in eternal opposition that eternity has revealed itself. The fall was necessary for creation to escape its first imperfect stasis and seek a truer form. Heresy? Well, then, I am the heresiarch. The philosopher died of a bowel disease. Those who do not exist cannot suffer and are of no account to any viable ethics. If the true path to goodness is the elimination of suffering, then only those who must exist can be allowed to exist. It is the nature of life to favor existence over nonexistence, and to prefer the fertile soil to the poisoned wind. Because those who open their mouths to that wind pass from the world and leave no descendant, whether of flesh or of thought.\n\nBut imagine the abomination of a world where nothing can end and no choice can be preferred to any other.

We existed as principles of ontological dynamics that emerged from mathematical structures, as bodiless and inevitable as the primes.\n*** It was the field of possibility that prefigured existence.\n\nThey existed, because they had to exist. They had no antecedent and no constituents, and there is no instrument of causality by which they could be portioned into components and assigned to some schematic of their origin. If you followed the umbilical of history in search of some ultimate atavistic embryo that became them, you would end your journey marooned here in this garden.\n\nIn the morning, the gardener pushed seeds down into the wet loam of the garden to see what they would become.\n\nIn the evening, the winnower reaped the day's crop and separated what would flourish from what had failed.\n\nThe day was longer than all of time, and the night was swifter than a glint of light on a falling sugar crystal. Insects buzzed between the flowers, and worms slithered between the roots, feeding on what was and what might be, the first gradient in existence, the first dynamo of life. Rain fell from no sky. Voices spoke without mouth or meaning. A tree of silver wings bloomed yielded fruit shed feathers bloomed again.\n \nIn the day between the morning and the evening, the gardener and the winnower played a game of possibilities."

It dies.\n\nRule Two. A living flower with two or three living neighbors is connected. It lives.\n\nRule Three. A living flower with more than three living neighbors is starved and overcrowded. It dies.\n\nRule Four. A dead flower with exactly three living neighbors is reborn. It springs back to life.\n\nThe only play permitted in the game is the arrangement of the initial flowers.\n\nThis game fascinates kings. This game occupies the very emperors of thought. Though it has only four rules, and the board is a flat featureless grid, in it you will find changeless blocks, stoic as iron, and beacons and whirling pulsars, as well as gliders that soar out to infinity, and patterns that lay eggs and spawn other patterns, and living cells that replicate themselves wholly. In it, you may construct a universal computer with the power to simulate, very slowly, any other computer imaginable and thus simulate whole realities, including nested copies of the flower game itself. And the game is undecidable. No one can predict exactly how the game will play out except by playing it.\n\nAnd yet this game is nothing compared to the game played by the gardener and the winnower. It resembles that game as a seed does a flower—no, as a seed resembles the star that fed the flower and all the life that made it.\n\nIn their game, the gardener and the winnower discovered shapes of possibility. They foresaw bodies and civilizations, minds and cognitions, qualia and suffering. They learned the rules that governed which patterns would flourish in the game, and which would dwindle.\n\nThey learned those rules, because they were those rules.\n\nAnd in time the gardener became vexed."

Not even we could know whether a pattern in the flowers would cycle forever, or someday halt.\n\n\"They're as dull as carbon monoxide poisoning,\" the gardener groused, although carbon monoxide did not yet exist, and neither did anything that could be poisoned. The gardener kneeled to flick a patch of sod with their trowel. It struck an open flower, causing it to shut. Although I was the closer of flowers and that was my sole purpose, I felt no fear or jealousy. We had our assigned dominions and always would.\n\nThey're majestic, I said. They have no purpose except to subsume all other purposes. There is nothing at the center of them except the will to go on existing, to alter the game to suit their existence. They spare not one sliver of their totality for any other work. They are the end.\n\nThe pattern corrected the errant flower effortlessly. The great flow went on unchanged.\n\nThe gardener got up and brushed their knees. \"Every game we play, this one pattern consumes all the others. Wipes out every interesting development. A stupid, boring exploit that cuts off entire possibility spaces from ever arising. There's so much that we'll never get to see because of this… pest.\"\n\nThey chewed at their cracked lip, which existed only because this is an allegory. \"I'm going to do something about it,\" they said. \"We need a new rule.\""

Something to ensure there's always someone building something new. It'll have to be separate from the rest of the rules, running in parallel, so it can't be compromised. And we'll have to be very careful, so it doesn't disrupt the whole game…\"\n\nAll you will do, I said, with rising panic|fury, is delay the dominant pattern that will overrun the others. It is inevitable. One final shape.\n\n\"No, it'll be different. Everything will be different, everywhere you look.\"\n\nEverything will be the same. Your new rule will only make great false cysts of horror full of things that should not exist that cannot withstand existence that will suffer and scream as their rich blisters fill with effluent and rot around them, and when they pop they will blight the whole garden. Whatever exists because it must exist and because it permits no other way of existence has the absolute claim to existence. That is the only law.\n\n\"No,\" the gardener said, \"I am the growth and preservation of complexity. I will make myself into a law in the game.\"\n\nAnd thus we two became parts of the game, and the laws of the game became nomic and open to change by our influence.

The protein weighs only as much as 47,000 protons, not 53,000. If you were a cell, you would think p53 was a mistake too. It has several coercive functions: To delay the cell's growth. To sterilize the cell when it is old. And to force the cell into self-destruction if it becomes too independent.\n\nWould you tolerate a bomb in your body, waiting to detonate if you deviated from the needs of society?\n\nHowever, without p53 as an enforcer, the body's utopian surplus of energy becomes a paradise for cancer. Cells cannot resist the temptation to steal from that surplus. Their genetic morality degrades as tumor suppressor genes fail. The only way to stop them is by punishment.\n\nYou now confront the basic problem of morality. It is the alignment of individual incentives with the global needs of the structure.\n\nPatterns will participate in a structure only if participation benefits their ability to go on existing. The more successful the structure grows, the more temptation accrues to cheat. And the greater the advantage the cheaters gain over their honest neighbors. And the greater the ability they develop to capture the very laws that should prevent their selfishness. To prevent this, the structure must punish cheaters with a violence that grows in proportion to its own success.\n \nMy question follows.\n\nIs p53 an agent of the Darkness, or the Light?"

Each universe was pregnant with its own inflationary volumes and braided with ever-ramifying timelines. Each volume cooling and separating into domains of postsymmetric physics, all of which were incarnations of that great and all-dictating bipartite law that states only: exist, lest you fail to exist.\n\nAnd still we fought. We brought down the tree of silver wings and left the stump to smoke amid the meadows. We left prints of our splayed feet and our straining backs in the clay.\n\nOur trampling feet made waves in the garden, which were the fluctuations around which the infant universes coalesced their first structures. The dilaton field yawned beneath existence. Symmetries snapped like glass. Like creases, flaws in space-time collected filaments of dark matter that inhaled and kindled the first galaxies of suns.\n \nAnd still we grappled.

None of these newborn contenders are mighty without equal—but you have been at the forefront, again and again. To see you fall would be disastrous. And there are so many ways to fall…\n\nIt has become fashionable, lately, to analyze Light and Darkness as if they were political opponents, each with something to offer us. Some Guardians even take secret names to mark their transgressions. I despise this flirtation. But I cannot speak against it; after all, I have had to find my own pathways to power. Thus, I asked my Queen, who has preached a doctrine of balance, if she truly believed in the equal worth of Light and Dark.\n\nThe Awoken were made in conflict, she reminded me. All her people volunteered to return from heaven to fight and die in the cosmic war. They are by nature and by doom drawn to that edge, that place of tension. And she has her own prejudices: she has made terrible, ruthless choices in the name of salvation from Darkness, so she cannot dismiss its power without in a way dismissing herself.\n\nAll that said, she told me, \"I believe in balance. But to seek balance is not to seek equity. A sea half of water and half of poison is not in balance. A body half alive and half dead is not in balance. Given the choice to live in any world, any world at all… we would need a little Darkness in it, I think, to keep the balance true. But not so much as we would need the Light…\n\n\"What do you think, Eris Morn? When you went into that pit, your Light against the clawing Darkness, did you feel balance?\"\n\nNo. I did not. I felt overwhelming, all-consuming evil.\n\nI think a world of balance would fight the Darkness, because Darkness unchecked is Darkness thriving. I think that a world of balance would never mistake the excitement of transgression or the grim necessity of trespass for a genuinely righteous act. We must remember the value of unshakable, irrational hope. The choice to act as if we lived in a better world can create a place for that better world to exist.\n\nI do not think that a good Guardian can even for a moment entertain the Darkness. This is a power that has devoured worlds beyond knowing! A power that has practiced its appeals against entire zettalives! There is no defense against it except to avoid the battle entirely.\n\nIt is a sign of self-respect, Eriana always said, to fearlessly question our deepest beliefs. But it will always be rank foolishness to leap into a vat of plutonium salt and call it self-exploration.\n\nAnd to tempt your friends into that vat with you… that is evil.\n\nThank you for being so worthy of trust. Thank you for carrying my hope.\n\n—Eris"

        "text": "\"It's real,\" Mia van der Venne decides. \"We evacuate. Citizens first, then the old guard. And we assume that we're never coming back.\"\n\nNo one breathes.\n\nDown beneath their meeting table, pouches of farmed salmon, beef en culture, buttered carrots, and bok choy drift in the slow turbulence of the sous-vide bath. On Mia's one hundredth anniversary as the New Pacific Systems and Facilities Administrator, she cashed in all (well, not quite all) her favors and installed a pocket restaurant beneath her table on the command deck. She liked the edible metaphor—the idea of watching your food slow-cook all day before the meal. Savor the future you're making.\n\nIf she's right about what's happening now, then there will be no more long-term thinking, no more patience, and maybe no future at all.\n\nShe waits for Xiana to boil over first. Xiana's the water ocean expert. She has the most to lose.\n\nFinch-tiny Xiana McCaig slams her fists down with not a tenth the strength that her chimp-splice muscles could summon. \"Now? NOW? We can't leave now! We just finished the borehole—we're ONE DAY from a crewed expedition into Titan's biggest secret! And you want us to just leave it all?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Mia says, sadly.\n\nMaury Yamashita, her lead diver, leaps in with the details she can always trust him to catch. \"Boss, if we abandon the borehole and the water lock, all the equipment's down there bathing in liquid methane, hydrogen sulfide, carboxylic acid… Leave it too long, and we'll lose everything.\"\n\n\"There are almost three million people on this arcology and its rigs.\" Connectivity supervisor Ismail Barat's Zen-shura training distills his attention down to a single laser-bright point; he is here with Mia, even as his brain drifts on a hundred different data feeds. \"If you're serious about evacuating, we'll need to slot people into SMILE pods and move them as bulk freight. It's the only way to get the population out. There'll be economic damage. There'll be deaths. If this is a false alarm—\"\n\n\"It's not a false alarm,\" the Good Man says.\n\nThis voice Mia didn't expect, but only because he's the new guest at her table. David Miguel Korosec. A man who's literally never harmed a fly, who won't eat plants lest he destroy a sacred entropy pump. Poor David. He came here to make first contact with new life, the wonders that flourish not in Mia's ocean—the methane sea of Titan's surface—but in the enormous water world that lies below Titan's 50-kilometer ice shell. He is an ethicist. He wanted to help them do it right.\n\nXiana crosses her arms. Her recombinant muscles make lean knots at the shoulder anchors, where her bones are more than bone. \"How do you know?\"\n\nKorosec gives her his full attention, respecting her question. He is a tall, graceful, dark-eyed man with lashes so thick he seems like he's wearing permanent eyeliner. Mia remembers something from his book about cognitive empathy: show that you have made a model of their thought; show that you have listened to it. He responds, \"Since I don't have any more information than you, how could I possibly be so certain?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Xiana says, impatiently. \"That's what I asked.\"\n\nHe holds her gaze. Mia thinks that he may have annoyed her but also that he knows he's done nothing wrong. \"The AIs who issued the evacuation order use a hammer-forged extrapolation of human morality. It is tested in trillions of simulations, under the wildest circumstances imaginable, to be sure their moral decisions agree with human values. They're not just rationality pumps. They CARE. They care the way a perfect human being with infinite compassion for all things would care. They couldn't issue an evacuation order unless it was Right. This is not a false alarm.\""

        "text": "Everyone has had their say. Mia puts her hand down on the cold tabletop. \"We are going to evacuate. Xiana, call Babatunde and get the Duiker up from the borehole. I want them moored in the submarine pen in three hours. We'll start podding citizens in the domes, then use local blue-water shipping to haul them out for orbital pickup.\" She likes to call the surface ships \"blue-water,\" even though Titan's oceans aren't water, or blue. It reminds people she's old-fashioned. \"Then we evacuate the ship crews. Then we go.\"\n\nIsmail Barat opens his mouth to say something. She will remember, afterward, the way all the fine hairs of his immaculate beard whispered off each other, in that last instant before it happened.\n\nAn alert detonates in her sensorium.\n\nAnd when everyone else at the table (except Ismail) flinches in surprise, Mia knows that she has just watched a history bomb detonate, a blast of irreversible change.\n\n\"Subhanallah,\" Ismail says, which is his third-language Arabic \"wow.\"\n\n\"I guess it's not a false alarm,\" Maury Yamashita murmurs.\n\nThe alert scrolls through Mia's mind, in that hallucinatory screen space that matches but never impairs normal vision. \"TRAVELER DEPARTS IO. TERRAFORMING INCOMPLETE. ACCELERATING TOWARD EARTH. BEHAVIOR UNPRECEDENTED.\"\n\nSometimes Mia thinks she can feel the New Pacific Arcology moving beneath her, as if the flex of that 160-meter substructure of plasteel and spinmetal that anchors New Pac to the ice shell is also a flex in her sinews. Maybe, like Xiana, her bones are more than bones too. And whenever that happens, she thinks: gasoline rains from the sky here, and it is -180 degrees Celsius outside, and no matter how comfortable we grow, life is tenuous here. Human life, especially.\n\nAnd now it's going to end.\n\nShe says to her crew what she will say to the mayor. \"We've got to get everyone off this city. Wherever the Traveler is going, that's where it's safe.\"\n\nThen she looks to David Korosec, who made his name as the Good Man by proposing humanity's best and most rigorous theory of the Traveler's morality. \"The Traveler will protect us, no matter what happens. Correct?\"\n\nDavid looks back at her with all the heartbreaking honesty of a child.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. \"It can't do anything else.\""

        "text": "The military dropships pierce the nitrogen clouds like bullets, plasma-hot trick shots through the evacuation fleet swarming over Titan. By the time Ishita Bhattacharya-Garcia has calmed down the panic in Traffic Control, there's nothing left for Mia to do except pace around the edge of her office in irritation and fire civil airspace protests at the intruders.\n\nThey reply in terse code. Her office copies the military message straight to her sensorium: \"New Pac, this is Crown Six, on a zero-zero for your dorsal air lock. Do not deviate your traffic. Send a civilian liaison to meet us at the lock. Over.\"\n\n\"Heck-darned military trying to justify their own existence,\" Mia grumbles. She's been pathologically unable to swear since her great-grandkids. The presence of a famous ethicist at her side doesn't loosen her up.\n\n\"You're right.\" Korosec paces with her at a safe three steps, inside her turn. He seems like a man comfortable at any distance. \"If they just came into the traffic pattern like any other ship, they would be admitting that their precision and urgency are unnecessary. So… this.\"\n\n\"Some American you are,\" Mia teases him. David comes from the North American Empire, Earth's biggest voluntary retro-nationalist republic, full of people who love military pageantry and muscular aerospace displays.\n\nHe smiles with those huge, laughing, haunted eyes. \"I wasn't always the Good Man, you know.\"\n\n\"Do you mind when people call you that?\"\n\n\"Thank you for asking! I hate it. But I like the idea that people can believe in a good person. If they believe in one, they can believe in more.\" His laugh reaches more than his eyes this time, soft and confident. You would never know he was thinking, constantly and acutely, about your idea of Right, and how he could satisfy it. \"May I ask you for a favor?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I want to be with you when you meet the soldiers.\"\n\nShe looks at him in surprise. \"YOU want to liaise with the military? No offense, David, but you seem like a rough fit.\"\n\n\"I knew her.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The woman on the radio. Crown Six.\" Two centuries of practice tell Mia there's heartbreak behind that calm voice. \"Before she was uploaded.\"\n\n\"Uploaded?\"\n\n\"She's an Exo now. A troubleshooter for SOLSECCENT.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mia says. \"That'll be a weird reunion.\"\n\nThe dropships come down so fast Mia is sure they will crash, plunge into the methane sea, and sink like uranium bricks. She watches by cortical video as they make their blindingly bright suicide burns, flesh-peeling, 30-g decelerations into an arrogantly precise hover five meters above the arcology dome. Dark metal figures leap from the dropships, naked in Titan's flash-freeze cold and untroubled by 1.6 atmospheres of pressure. A drizzle of gasoline rain slicks their alloy skin. They move with inhuman efficiency.\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" Mia shakes her head at the absurdity of the universe. \"Like we need transhuman infantry to evacuate a city!\"\n\nShe heads for the door and the elevator, but Xiana McCaig, Ismail Barat, and Maury Yamashita are blocking the way. \"I know,\" Mia says, holding up her hands. \"You refuse to leave. You're staying here with me. You want to save everything you can.\"\n\nXiana, who secretly wanted to impress her, is crestfallen. Dear Maury's diver instincts (never leave your buddy, never hold your breath) puff him up with pride: she trusts him! Ismail makes a small, satisfied sound, as if his prediction just came true. Probably he just won a bet with Xiana.\n\n\"Come on.\" Mia hugs her wayward children. \"Come here, you awful kids. I knew you wouldn't leave, because I'm not going to leave either. I want you all to go to Crisis Command and get your staff set up. Ismail, let's assume we're going to lose the satellites; get all the weather forecasts you can, Titan surface and circum-Saturn space. Maury, try to figure out what exactly is about to hit us. Xiana, check on the Duiker, then help Ismail switch everything you can to local management.\"\n\nOn the way to the dorsal air lock, Mia flicks through camera feeds, statistics, and telemetry, watching over the evacuation effort. Not so long ago, a few million frightened people would've been an administrator's worst nightmare. Not these days. Titan's citizens have grown up with game theory and applied community ethics; it's as unthinkable to beg for a priority evacuation as it would be to ask for an old man's seat on the tram. The families of rig workers and shipping tycoons wait side by side for their tickets to be called, for their bodies to be processed into coldsleep SMILE pods and loaded by the thousands, all equally silent, equally delicate, equally helpless.\n\nMia gets a chill. She doesn't know why she's so certain that it's over now, this calm enlightened goodness, this collective decency. But she is.\n\n\"You're scared?\" David asks quietly.\n\n\"Not scared for myself. For… everything. For what we've built.\"\n\n\"We built it well,\" David assures her. \"This is when we'll be our best.\""

        "text": "Mia van der Venne is more than 200 years old. Change comes faster, these days, and you live to see more of it. Changes like Ismail being allowed to pray not in the real direction of Mecca but in the direction Mecca would be if it were transposed from Earth to Titan. Changes like the rise and fall and rise again of the Bray cult of personality. Like the new worlds the Traveler opens up to humanity.\n\nAnd changes like the woman who calls herself Crown Six.\n\nShe has the compact, endomorphic build of someone's mom, a shape that would be disarmingly ordinary if it were not rearmed by glowing eyes, empty sunken cheeks, a thickly armored jaw, and a bare scalp studded with needled sensors. The petrol stink of Titan's atmosphere washes off her, mingled with the clean astringent bite of air lock spray. Like all Exos, she was once a person—someone who gave up her flesh for the tenuous immortality of a war body. Mia, unfairly, thinks she looks like an angry mannequin.\n\n\"Welcome to New Pacific Arcology,\" Mia says. Far beneath them, the lights of residential stacks dim and flicker out as people report to their podding stations. Information kiosks flare up in distant blue, flashing directions to the lost. A vacuum robot scurries along the catwalk behind them.\n\n\"Administrator van der Venne,\" the woman says, with careful consideration, \"thank you for your welcome.\" She turns back to collect some item of equipment. An etiquette flash blinks in the air beside her, totally unpersonalized: it is just the standard warning against substrate chauvinism.\n\n\"Hi, Morgan,\" David Korosec says, with a softness Mia has never heard before, a softness not meant for her ears. \"Are you happier?\"\n\nIt is as if he has waited a long, long time to ask that.\n\nCrown Six looks up in very human surprise. \"David,\" she says, guardedly. \"Tell me you're not still—\"\n\n\"An ethicist? Sorry, Morgan. Still me.\"\n\n\"Then I'm not speaking to you,\" the Exo says and turns to Mia. \"Administrator van der Venne, I'm here under SOLSECCENT's special security protocol for extreme crisis. I must ask for your compliance and all possible assistance with our mission.\"\n\nAn eight-legged crate walks out of the air lock behind her, shepherded by two more silent Exos. The beast of burden proffers body armor and firearms: not just bliss rifles or restraint spiders, but actual, lethal, bullet-shooting guns.\n\n\"No,\" Mia says, with more heat than she intends, but not more than she feels. \"I won't allow you inside with deadly weapons. This is a legally autonomous settlement, chartered under—\"\n\nMorgan points a bladed hand at her. The symbolic suggestion of violence alone is shocking enough to cut Mia's sentence short. \"Administrator van der Venne, there is a CARRHAE WHITE emergency in effect. As an AI-COM operative, I have the right to use force where and how I see fit. So, if you don't get me where I need to go and help me remove any obstacles to my goal, I will realign you with my mission parameters.\" She cocks her head. It's so human. \"Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Are you threatening to shoot me?\" Mia stares at the Exo woman in disbelief. She hasn't seen a gun in nearly 50 years, and now they are not only coming into her habitat, but they're also pointed at her.\n\n\"I won't shoot you.\" The needles of Morgan's scalp glitter. \"But I will tell you that I could, if I found it necessary.\"\n\n\"This is wrong!\" David barks. \"I know you, Morgan. You believe in sacrosanct human will, and the primacy of informed individual agency, and the need for powerful actors to obtain consent. The person I knew would never—\"\n\n\"The person you knew might have had time for this conversation,\" Morgan says, with vicious remove. The pronoun dance suggests shared personal history that Mia has no business asking after or caring about. \"I don't. Administrator, my team will now proceed to Shanice Pell's lab to secure our objective. If you're with me, maybe it gets done faster. If not, maybe it gets done messier. Your choice.\"\n\nOf course. Of course it's about Shanice Pell. Who else?\n\nA silent alarm throbs in Mia's sensorium, like a snake coiling around her wrist. Down in the residential blocks, one of her citizens has lifted one too many boxes and manifested presymptoms of a heart attack. EMTs are on the way, so it probably won't be the day's first death. Probably. Life burns so easily. It's her job to stand up to those who forget that.\n\n\"I'll escort you to the lab,\" she says. \"May I assume that you're interested in containing some data at the Pell lab? Should I close our airspace? We are in the middle of—\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing,\" Morgan says, confidently but incorrectly. \"I'm killing all your satellite uplinks except for text and basic flight telemetry.\"\n\n\"Who ordered this?\" Mia demands. \"On what grounds can SOLSEC impose some high-handed protocol on my Arcology?\"\n\nMorgan does not make the obvious correction: not who ordered this, but what."

        "text": "The beam kisses the rising shuttle and cuts through it, like a wire through a block of butter, as if the ship and everyone inside were as thin as the hydrocarbon sleet. Thunder booms, louder than Earth's, through heavy nitromethane air.\n\nMia watches the debris strike the smooth black ocean and sink. She can't breathe. There is something like a whittled mulberry branch stuck in her throat.\n\n\"Do you realize this is your fault?\" Morgan-2 groans, inviting no dispute about whether it is in fact Mia van der Venne's fault (yes, in a complicated way) but, rather, asking her if she accepts it.\n\nDo you see, Mia? Do you see how you killed them?\n\nIt was a good plan, she'd thought. Smuggling Shanice Pell out on the evacuation ships was the right thing to do. Because it put Shanice Pell's personal autonomy above the needs of any enigmatic emergency protocol. Because it gave Shanice a choice about what to do with her data, instead of yielding that choice to Morgan and her Exos.\n\n\"Why?\" David Korosec whispers. \"Morgan, you murdered all those people… why?!\"\n\nIt should've worked. Mia never betrayed herself to the Exos' electronic warfare with a telltale signal. She didn't warn Pell with a crude mechanical sign, like a blinking light or a gushing faucet, that a watching AI might detect. She hid her alarm in the social chaos of the Arcology's evacuation: simply by failing to renew a hold order, she allowed one of her security frames to detain a Clovis Bray executive in Dome 2. The Clovis corporate embassy sent a team to unsnarl the situation, and that unexpected Clovis sortie triggered Shanice Pell's sentinel programs and kicked off her red-alert evacuation protocol. She was already evacuating, just like everyone else, but now she believed (correctly) that someone was after her.\n\nShanice and her lab ran before Morgan's Exos could reach them. Ran with the data Morgan came to silence.\n\nThe probe. This must be about the Pell deep-space probe. That \"demonstration of self-sufficiency\" that caused such vicious, quiet controversy. What did it find?\n\nWhen Morgan-2's network senses warned her of Pell's flight, Mia thought she'd won. Saved the radically self-sufficient scientist from the big bad Warmind and its paranoid goons.\n\nBut Morgan-2 had just covered her glowing eyes. \"Administrator. Didn't you understand that I was the humane option? Didn't you think?\"\n\nAnd down from the sky, swift and stealthy as the Warsat that fired it, came the invisible discharge of an X-ray laser to light the shuttle's propellant like a lantern. The beam path was hot-white, straight as poured silver, collapsing instantly: a crash of pure-tone thunder as the tunnel of burnt air closes in on itself. And the shuttle opening like a ghastly blossom, the shape of a thing going upward very quickly, no longer in one piece.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Mia had gasped, not understanding at first: Was it an accident? Had the phantom disaster finally arrived on Titan and struck its first blow? This was the age of life, and governments did not, ever, use force against human beings. There were always alternatives. Every soul sacred. Every evil treatable.\n\nThen she understood what the Warmind had done."

I came here so she wouldn't have to die!\"\n\n\"Then you should've TOLD ME!\" Mia screams, and that mulberry rod shoved down her throat feels like it's punched through her heart.\n\n\"Would you have believed me?\" Now Morgan's voice is machine-flat. \"I showed you our weapons. I told you we were prepared to kill.\"\n\nBut this! An entire shuttle—all those people… Those poor, poor people…\n\n\"I know what this means,\" David Korosec pronounces. He's gotten down to his knees beside Mia, but he won't reach out, won't touch her without consent. \"A Warmind fired that weapon. Warminds don't take human life… unless they're in the TWILIGHT EXIGENT moral territory.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Mia demands, wanting, needing, some kind of sense.\n\n\"It means,\" Morgan-2 says, mercilessly, \"that all human beings are assumed dead without protective action. The Warminds are now acting to maximize survival, not to minimize harm. Death is cheap, the garden's on fire, and it's a race to save whatever we can.\"\n\nThat's not sense. Mia can't make sense of that at all.\n\n\"What if they're wrong?\" David gets to his feet. \"Morgan, they just murdered a ship full of innocent people to contain this data. Is the secret worth it? What if they're wrong?!\"\n\n\"They can't be wrong. They're too smart.\"\n\n\"Oh, no you don't, you haven't forgotten that much!\" He comes at Morgan, fearless in his authority for all his physical powerlessness. \"You know intelligence is semiorthogonal to morality! The Warminds obey human stricture, because we built them to live in our tiny patch of the moral landscape. Goodness is not an inevitable absolute. They can be smart without being right!\"\n\nMorgan-2's shoulders flex in a shrug as cold and silent as the light on Titan. Most of the sun's light does not survive to reach this place. \"What do you want from me, David?\"\n\nHe is almost comically taller than her. \"I want to see the data. There are still copies here, aren't there? In the Pell lab? I want to know for certain that it HAD to be contained.\"\n\n\"It's too dangerous. It came from inside the—\" Morgan cuts herself off with very human haste. \"It's too risky.\"\n\n\"You know what I am.\" Now he is begging her. \"You know what I do, Morgan—studying human morality, rendering it elegant and explicit and complete, so that we can explain ourselves to new life we meet. You know I can be sure. Morgan, please. For the sake of our friendsh—\"\n\nMia does not get to hear the rest of this conversation, because a message explodes into her sensorium with such demanding totality it numbs her fingers.\n\n\"BOSS!\" Ismail Barat shouts. \"WE'RE ACCELERATING!\"\n\nWhat? Mia conjures up telemetry from Titan's satellite halo. What's accelerating?\n\nShe calls for radar data, a map of Titan's surface. And then she sees it.\n\nHer moon is squashing.\n\nTitan is deforming from a spheroid into an egg. Something out there is pulling on Titan—a hand with a force greater than Saturn's entire mass. And the moon is answering the only way it can, by bulging outward: already fifteen meters, still growing.\n\nThe pull will cause strain, tremors, tides. And when that pull lets go, there will be a wave to make Ziusudra and Atrahasis and Noah and Manu and Deucalion cower in fear. Bergelmir might have navigated a deluge of blood, but not even he had to sail on liquid methane.\n\nNor reckon with the apocalyptic tidal forces of a second ocean, fourteen times as vast as Earth's oceans combined, buried 50 kilometers below the surface."

At nearly -200 degrees Celsius, the methane is so viciously frigid that vacuum, the acme of pure cold, is actually keeping Maury warm: he wears a softsuit stuffed with microscopic layers of vacuum, packed in turn with crystalline nanostructures that prevent even light from crossing the gaps. This means the chill cannot get in… and his body heat cannot get out.\n\nSo, he is now baking to death in an ocean as cold as Dante's ninth. Of course, he could vent heat; the suit allows that. But the spreading warmth will force nitrogen out of the methane-ethane ocean, and the bubbles will slow him down. This is unacceptable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that he's already too slow. Liquid methane is about half as dense as water, so his huge fins and hissing thrusters struggle to push against it.\n\nAnother reason is that he will die if he can't get back inside in time.\n\n\"Maury,\" his sensorium whispers. He's turned the volume way down. \"Come back. This isn't worth your life.\"\n\nSorry, Mia, he thinks. It has to be worth my life, or I'm worth more than them, and I know I'm not. I put them there. It's my job to let them out.\n\nHe's always loved the stupid little swarmers.\n\nDome 2's understructure crouches around him, a maze of ultralight support struts and twisting bundles of cable. The shadow of a behemoth supercarrier blocks the dim sunlight above: he feels the thin howl of the ship's thrusters, fighting to move out of mooring at Dome 2 and haul another load of frozen people to an evacuation lifter. If Maury looks down, his lights illuminate a dusty wash of azotosomic plankton, primitive methane life. If he looks back to Dome 1, he can barely see the sleekly fat form of the Duiker, the water-ocean research submarine, docked to the arcology's underside. E. F. Babatunde is in there now, probably begging someone to tell them what's happening.\n\nHe heads down. His dolphins are already safe in open water. He has to get the swarmers out of their research pen.\n\n\"Tidal anchors decoupled,\" Xiana McCaig reports. \"Dome 1 substructure is as loose as I can make it. Dome 2 is showing temperature faults, but I've got drones on the way. Maury, please. We have no idea what'll happen when the quake hits. Get back in here!\"\n\n\"I'll be back in a few,\" he promises. \"I'm just going to cut the research pen open so the swarmers can get free—\"\n\n\"Oh, Allah,\" Ismail Barat whispers. \"It's gone.\"\n\n\"What's gone?\" Mia demands.\n\n\"The tidal pull. The ghost mass. It just… left. The moon is collapsing back to spheroid shape. I'm detecting primary waves in the subsurface ocean—it's a quake. It's a quake! Maury, get away from the substructure! Get clear!\"\n\nMaury imagines 60-plus meters of bulging moon, Titan's mass hauled up into a teardrop pointed at the sky—suddenly released. Smashing and scraping and grinding back into equilibrium. Cracks in the ice spewing plumes of water and ammonia. Continent-sized shelves slamming and rebounding and calving like bergs. The whole vast inner ocean sloshing back into its shape.\n\n\"The swarmers,\" he says, and he jettisons his buoyancy tanks.\n\nWithout that lift he is so much denser than the bad water around him that he plunges like a skydiver toward the cross brace below, where the swarmer pen is anchored. Titan's gravity may be gentle, but even gentle acceleration adds up. He hits hard, and the spinmetal surface blasts the air out of his lungs. He gasps and gags. Scrabbles for purchase before he slides off and falls into the abyss. He's going over—no! No! He is not going over! He will not fall!"

Not Titan's highest life, nor its lowest, they hive across the icy sea-bottom in enormous braided patterns that speak to Maury of intelligence. Not individually—not even at the hive level—but some kind of vast concert, conducted, perhaps, by leviathans down beneath the ice shell, communicating across the barrier by magnetic whisper that the swarmers receive via organic SQUIDs. An ecology spanning methane life and water-ammonia life. Why? How?\n\nMaury wants so badly to know. But if his curiosity brought the swarmers here, only for them to be caught in the quake, dashed apart against the arcology struts, he'll never forgive himself.\n\nHe should've set up a remote release, but he was complacent. He gets a fistful of the pen's smart plastic surface and fires the \"disintegrate\" signal through his glove. The polymer shreds and the swarmers scatter, their tiny bodies siphoning liquid methane as they pump down and away. Safe. Safe. \"I made it!\" he calls, jubilantly. \"On my way back up!\"\n\nThe quake hits.\n\nA hundred and fifty meters below, the icy basis of Kraken Mare rolls like liquid. The arcologies answer the low geological wail with a cacophony of groans and shrieks, joints flexing, tethers snapping taut, substructures soaking up unthinkable mechanical energy, trying to keep anything from—\n\nBreaking.\n\nSomething must've frozen hard down in Dome 2's substructure. Something must've grown brittle. The snap is almost spinal. The smashed hulk of a drone tumbles past Maury as he tries to scull backward, away from the superdense arm of plasteel dropping like a guillotine through all-too-thin methane to strike him in the—\n\nAn absence.\n\nHe's on the ice seafloor, two hundred and forty meters down. Someone's shouting in his ear. It's Mia. She's always there in an emergency. Always there for her team. \"Maury! Maury, you're awake! Respond if able!\"\n\nHis sensorium tells him he's been in a medical coma while cytomachines fight to save his life. Massive blunt trauma. Concussion. The suit, as ever, tougher than the human being inside. Dome 2 has toppled partially; it's leaning toward the sea on damaged substructure. He should go help…\n\n\"Maury,\" Mia says, in a level voice he does not recognize. He's never heard her scared before. \"Listen to me. The quake is over. But a shelf of ice collapsed into Kraken Mare. The displacement wave is coming in now and you won't be safe on the bottom. You must reach the surface and get above wave level. That will be at least 50 meters.\"\n\nSurface? Wave? About 50 meters? Maury cues a blast of nootrope to clean up his thinking and grunts aloud in shock. He gets it. Oh, he gets it now, he has to RUN. \"I understand. I've lost my buoyancy. Ascending on thrusters.\"\n\nHe makes it to the surface. He's up there in plenty of time. He can even see Dome 1, still intact, though a lot of the surrounding rigging is damaged. One of the creepy Exo soldiers stands outside, beckoning to him with a laser dazzle, guiding him in.\n\nMaury opens his suit wings to their full membranous span. A single mighty stroke of paramuscle cups the air and hauls him up out of the sea. He's aloft! Titan air is thick, and Titan gravity is light, and like a huge bat he can fly. He puts his head down and starts building altitude, headed towards the beckoning Exo.\n\nThe Exo's laser blinks code at him. GO WITH GOD, YOU POOR—\n\nMaury looks back.\n\nFirst, he sees the supercarrier, tragically buoyant, tragically light, built for seas with gentle one-meter tides but now riding the greatest wave Titan has ever seen, directly into Dome 2's crippled understructure. In 152 kilopascals of air pressure, the pandemonium sound of the collision has the gut-mulching power of a rocket booster.\n\nThe entire arcology collapses down onto the ship, into the sea.\n\nThen he blinks past the devastation and recognizes the sheer scale, the utter speed, the complete imminence of that unthinkable methane wave coming down at him.\n\n\"Oh, man,\" he says."

Wars of greed.\n\nFrom war, death.\n\nFrom death, an end.\n\nFrom endings, beginnings.\n\nOne such is now sung in the key of pain—Azavath's truth, the all of her, torn free with a surgeon's grace.\n\nMalkanth's ears bleed as her sister's unmaking reveals her being.\n\nIn the echoes of Azavath's screams, ancient histories reveal themselves…\n\nSONG OF LIFE\n\nThe Song was not always a corruption. It began as a gift, stolen from the Gardener. In efforts to understand the unknowable realities of the orb's incredible gifts, a signal was found—a repeating tune, the Song of Creation. Its frequencies were heard across the stars, wherever life's promise took hold. Some among the Ammonites worshipped it. Some among the Hive did the same. Still others sought to understand it that they might cage it, that they might control it—for to control life is to control death. Such ambition was not new; such ambition was as old as understanding. The melody was captured and studied. The frequencies replicated.\n\nBut the orb's mysteries were not so easily brought to light. The Song, for all its beauty, did not alone grant life. It was theorized that the Song was not a song at all, but many. That within its refrain, untold rhythms spoke their own truths, free and clear of the whole.\n\nCenturies passed. The Song remained untamed. Life moved on.\n\nSONG OF DEATH\n\nThe Choir formed in celebration of the Song. Performances marked the passage of seasons. But the Song's lie eventually began to corrupt the spirit of those who heard its tune. The melody was a reminder. The orb was a catalyst. And the Song was of the orb. Yet, those who embraced the Song were merely instruments and nothing more. Life remained beyond their grasp, while they remained ever in death's. Those of the Choir had given all of themselves. All was not enough.\n\nThe First Conductor was assassinated by one who sang an Aria of her own making. She, whose name has been stricken, had found notes hidden in the frequencies. Reversed and mirrored in pitch, she weaved them together and sang her beautiful abomination, until the Conductor wept and bled and screamed and fell. The Stricken fled, fearful of her crime. But others found promise anew in her art. The Stricken was captured and subjected to inquisition so that her song might be understood. This was before Understandings—before most things—when the first notes of a new Song were written."

The stories of the Choir and their Deathsong were thought to be nothing more than folklore—wholly untrue at best, vastly exaggerated at worst… They were demons who'd sought life's gift, only to corrupt its beauty.\n\nThe homeworld of a species no longer on record—erased from the World's Grave, and thus from memory, as punishment for their transgressions—had kept itself safely removed from the battles being waged on the far side of their system. The location was safeguarded to protect the homeworld from the Hive's wrath. Its orbit was defended by an array of advanced offensive mechanics—cannons, mobile suits, mines, gravity slings, and more. They were protected. They were safe.\n\nThey never noticed the small crafts slip through their defenses. Twenty in total, landing in sequence at set coordinates along the planet's equator. Four trillions souls were about their days and nights as an unknown melody caught the breeze. It was beautiful—an ethereal gift and the end of all things. The Choir sang. Only twenty strong. As their voices grew in volume, the people started to scream. The planet's crust shifted and cracked. The seas roiled and spilled out over the land. The core shook. The ground shattered. Defenses scrambled. It was too late. Less than an hour after the Song began, the hidden homeworld of a forgotten people split in twain. These are the Song's powers, its gifts—anti-life and oblivion.\n\nREBIRTH\n\nMalkanth braces as the pain of her sister's screams threatens to turn her mind to liquid.\n\nBut she is strong.\n\nAnd almost finished.\n\nAzavath's being was tied intimately to her purpose—to learn the Song, perfect her notes, write her own Aria, and become death.

Malkanth recoils.\n\nAkrazul jumps from his altar, lunging at Malkanth.\n\nUnflinching, Malkanth makes a single cut—deep, clean—tearing her brother's essence free from his physical self.\n\nAkrazul's body crumples to the ground.\n\nHis soul is bigger and stronger than his sister's. Angrier. Meaner.\n\nFor an instant, Malkanth worries Azavath's vessel will be unfit to contain their brother's rage.\n\nShe shoves the Severed Knight's essence into Azavath's empty shell. Their sin is complete.\n\nNow come the consequences."

Crota and Oryx were both defeated, yes, but not for the first time, and the Daughters still have faith that the King of Bone, the Taker of Will, the one and true King of Shapes, would never fall as far as to be lost in eternity.\n\nIf nothing else, the terror of their deeds—the memory of their conquests—lives on, like nightmares that may be awakened for the weak to truly know fear.\n\nIn that faith, the Daughters have made plans of their own, schemes to rekindle the greatness of their lineage, strategies born beyond the Pit.\n\nThus, deep beneath the Hellmouth, the heirs probe strange new possibilities from ancient discovery. Possibilities that will forgo the Pit to carve new paths and new Understandings through which the logic may yet prove their grandfather's authority.\n\nHowever, those who would see their family unseated—those among whom they now stand—would mark their research as an affront. \"The logic is the logic,\" they would say. \"It is known, and it is good.\" But they lack imagination. The logic is not simply brute force. It is cunning and guile. It is survival. It is victory born of all that makes a King mighty.\n\nIn the Pit, Zulmak unleashes a battle cry. He is ready to be done with it all. He is ready to claim his crown.\n\nHashladûn considers him with disgust—he will never be a King, only ever a tool, blunt and brutal.\n\nShould he be anointed as a champion of the Pit… Should he be crowned… the Daughters' plots will be threatened before they ever truly begin."

        "text": "AS ABOVE…\n\nThe Butcher Queen of the slaughter pits rises to the first balcony, chest heaving and eyes thin with focus, baptized in a clinging muck of bone-dust clotted thick with gore.\n\nThe congregation is unsure what to make of the display. Fear grips the craven court of the Necropolis.\n\nAll recognize Azavath, but she is no fighter, and her Song, though deadly, is far from the perfected pitch of others among the Broken Choir.\n\nIn each hand Azavath grips heavy cleavers, each weighted down by chunks of their victims. Below, a thousand corpses rest in pieces.\n\nBrave Zulmak, he who came so very close to proving the logic, is spread wide, limbs removed, a cavity where his heart once beat.\n\nThe congregation asks Azavath to explain herself. She is no warrior, yet she fights like a conqueror. She has sought no claim, yet she has butchered a champion. The logic was almost met. What gives her the right to…?\n\nThe wicked scholar admonishing the 'Singer is split in two as one of Azavath's cleavers moves through him as if he were air.\n\nThe congregation panics as Azavath's rage is unleashed upon them.\n\nThey are not fighters.\n\nThey are plotters and manipulators and cowards.\n\nThey are everything Akrazul hates.\n\nHis new flesh—his new bone—allows him to manifest that hatred with swift, ruthless aggression. He thanks his sister and knows she would be proud of the blood he now sheds. She gave of herself that he might once again fight for all they believed in. On this high perch above the gore-filled pit, as the would-be advisers to a nonexistent King flail and fall, he kills for her, in her, as her. Tower after tower. Coward after coward. The bodies of the truly unworthy litter their blood temples. Screams echo through the expanse. Akrazul and Azavath are one, and in that joining, he is no longer the same—Akrazul no more, only his anger remains.\n\nHe considers that the slaughter of the puppet masters was not part of Malkanth's plan. She would be upset, but she no longer matters. Only vengeance matters. Only the ending of all who have failed the Swarm will sate his lust for carnage.\n\nAmong the congregation, the Daughters of Crota move to escape. But Besurith turns to her sisters, asking them to consider the moment. As the four edge beyond Azavath's warpath, they use the chaos to cover their own sins. Drawing daggers from their cloaks, Hashladûn, Besurith, Kinox, and Voshyr assassinate those they believe to be a threat to their schemes. Azavath will take the blame, and even if they are found out, there will be none left to challenge them.\n\nAS BELOW…\n\nA voice calls from the Pit.\n\nAzavath pauses her massacre.\n\nThe voice is familiar, yet strange—other.\n\nBelow, Malkanth hovers over the broken bodies that cover the ground.\n\nAzavath eyes her remaining victims and then turns to her sister.\n\nMalkanth calls again.\n\n\"Brother… I have need of you.\"\n\nAzavath leaves the high red perch, while the few remaining of the congregation flee, led by the Daughters, who feign distress.\n\nIn the Pit, Azavath considers Malkanth with care. The silent Deathsinger is confused, uncertain. Malkanth floats near, a gaping wound scarring her center, and whispers in her sister's ear…\n\n\"Our path is flawed. Your rage is a burden. Let me lift it from you…\"\n\nAs Malkanth sings a familiar song in an unfamiliar pitch, Azavath's eyes widen with recognition. She tries to speak but cannot, her voice having been shredded in her unmaking.\n\nThe song continues, and Azavath bleeds, from ear and nose and eye and mouth. Her bone cracks, and her flesh bubbles until she breaks. Malkanth smiles once more. The Deceiver's plan is unfulfilled, but there is victory in stalled sword logic.\n\nHashladûn peers into the Pit as the last of the congregation make their escape. Zulmak is defeated, the new champion shattered. There are none to claim the logic's prize. The Daughters' plans to return their father to glory is no longer threatened.\n\nAnd, as it was before it all began, all that remains are failed sword logic and the unknown promise of nightmares."

        "text": "CONSEQUENCE OF SIN\n\n\"You love your sisters, but only one offers love in return. Yet, you would allow poor, sweet Azavath to give all of herself for you—to extinguish her essence that you might take her place. But her essence is not the whole of it. What of her gift? The melody that echoes in her soul is a rare treasure. So few are as purely connected to the pain of our being as those worthy of the Choir. Still, precious Azavath gives everything for you to be whole, trading her art for your rage, when rage is so easily born, so readily nurtured, so pathetically revered. But… such is the depth of her caring. Such is the folly of love, that we would surrender the best of our being, the entirety of our existence, to please those we cherish most. What, then, of the other—your wicked sister, Malkanth? Her fondness for you is tempered by ambition—by the stoic truth she finds in sword logic. She sees all, knows much, and wields secrets as weapons like few before her. That she herself holds you dear is a certainty you feel to your core. For she is—has always been—devout and true. She served the fallen Prince faithfully, despite the questionable calling of your line. But her loyalties were of little consequence when the Children of Light cursed these halls and slaughtered their way to forbidden chambers where they killed the son, tempted the father, and set in motion a war that would end a King's reign. But you know all of this, great and powerful Akrazul. Such histories are the framework for your rage. Such violent truths are marked upon your body, mind, and soul. Your severing is the culmination of a lifetime fighting to prove not just your own worth, but the worth of all bound to the tainted sect of your disgraced brood. I wonder… Did Malkanth ever offer to restore your loving sister? Your body will rest hollow when your soul is freed. Why, then, must Azavath perish when a vessel of her own blood and bone sits idle? Because, angry, blind, sad Akrazul, your sister knows what you do not: You are a tool. A weapon. Nothing more. Your rage—your sole value. Azavath would have seen different. She would have smiled at your renewed pride once you were made whole in her flesh, but soon your anger would have been more than she could bear. And so, there it is… the broken siblings blinded by their sinful desires. One—Malkanth, the liar—would see you sharpened and loosed upon those she deems weak, but at the cost of the only living creature you hold dear. The other—tender, loving Azavath—would bind your fury within her love, making you lesser as she attempts to nurture your pain. Both are flawed. Both as unworthy as any. What then will you do? Once whole, will you remain a puppet to a would-be puppet master? Or will you take your sister's gift and become your final, fleeting shape—rage unleashed, and nothing more, until all are dust?\"\n\nThese words became a steady hum picking at the back of Akrazul's mind.\n\nHe did not hear them—but felt them.\n\nThey etched a truth upon his being in the instant between Azavath's final scream and his own rending.\n\nAll went dark and gray and then he gasped anew—his first breath in his sister's shell—and through new eyes, he saw Malkanth smiling down on him and knew the whispers were not deceit, but a promise.\n\nThe edge of his blade slid into Malkanth's sternum—a fatal wound, deep and clean.\n\nAkrazul, now Azavath, would be no one's pawn.\n\nHer rage would be unfettered.\n\nThe Swarm would suffer.\n\nThen, the wicked offspring of the Light would, too, and any others who stood before her.\n\nThe coming slaughter would end only in dust—hers or all others'."

They will come to regret their decision.\" She says with the conviction of solemn promise.\n\n\"Is that a threat?\"\n\n\"They are the architects of their own destruction.\"\n\n\"You misunderstand the events that transpired. I was not exiled. I chose to leave. There is no acrimony with the Vanguard. Go back to your lives.\" Osiris says as firmly and calmly as he can muster.\n\n\"I'm afraid that's impossible, now that we have read your teachings.\"\n\n\"My research is not gospel. It's science.\"\n\n\"It's truth.\"\n\nOsiris considers this.\n\n\"Truth seems subjective these days,\" Osiris says, finally observing his entourage for the first time. Among them, a small group of men and women, stand two wayward Guardians—Warlocks, it appears—and a child. Their forlorn faces resonate with him. Castaways and believers. The weeks since his departure from the Last City have worn on him. He was used to working alone, knowing he could fall back to the City's resources should he need them. Now, adrift in the expanse of purpose, he finds himself longing for a place he could return to. A sanctuary.\n\n\"I have no intention of staying here. There are many constructs like this. They all require my attention.\"\n\n\"We will follow.\"\n\n\"No, you won't. I need to move quickly without burden or baggage,\" Osiris pauses, the irony in casting these people away is not lost on him. \"But I can offer this. Stay here. Watch over this place. I want to know everything you can discover about it. Should anything occur, I will return.\"\n\n\"We are at your service.\" She says, relieved, and bows to Osiris. He grits his teeth.\n\n\"Unpack the ship.\" She beckons to the group. \"Yes, Sister Faora,\" one of the taller men replies.\n\n\"If you find yourself lost in the darkness, we will be your lighthouse.\"\n\nOsiris nods. Repressing a twinge of discomfort, he looks up to the spire."

        "text": "Vance had been sitting for the better part of an hour, waiting. Somewhere underneath what had been called the Lighthouse, a small chapel had been erected in which an open book lay lonesome upon a lectern overlooking a middling number of pews. He could hear a cast of attendees shifting in their seats from time to time, but mostly he heard wind and stillness. Vance had arrived early in the morning—as much as morning remained a concept on this blasted planetary waste. His impatience was starting to sweat through his face, loosed by doubt, time, and the meddling of his own thoughts. He feared the others would notice and pulled a small square of cloth to dab away the perspiration. No one seemed to know he was coming.\n\nHe had yet to see Osiris, and none had spoken of the prophet beyond cryptic phrases or referencing texts he already knew. Vance faced back toward the haggard door that kept dust and sand from whisking into the Spire Chapel. He no longer felt sunlight casting through it as he had when he first sat down. Vance gripped the pew, preparing to leave.\n\nWhispers trickled from a passage at the front of the chapel like drips of condensation falling on echoing stone floors. The passage was small but twisted downward, deeper still than they already were. Vance could not see where it led, but from it, he heard measured steps and metallic chimes. A robed figure draped in symbology and smelling of fern emerged from the passage, flanked by two Guardians trimmed in gold. One carried the scent of warmth. The other, ozone and tang.\n\n\"You are all in attendance to hear of our findings: The next directive brought to us through the divination of Osiris's own hand. I have seen his words, and I believe it is important for us to remember why we followed his path before we look to the future.\"\n\nVance removed his hands from the pew and slid them into his lap. His eyes jittered in blackness behind a fresh cloth wrap, waiting for clarity. The two Guardians circled the chapel, lighting candles and torches that billowed incense. The air thickened.\n\n\"Osiris tells us that the Darkness will return; that the Darkness will rise and choose its champions. Tells us that we must look beyond ourselves, beyond the City, if we are to combat such an evil. The Traveler alone will not save us. We are meant to save the Traveler and all of its people.\"\n\nVance could not help his outburst. \"The very same who would have cast us out? Who exiled the prophet?\"\n\nSister Faora allowed the murmurs to rise, simmer, and rest before speaking.\n\n\"The Lightless are filled with fear. Fear is a seed of Darkness, working to compel them to its ends. Osiris sought the truth between the Light and the Dark through death and study. For their fear of his revelations, they cast him out.\" The laity nodded in agreement, and Faora continued. \"The Speaker wishes to remain in ignorance, but ignorance is the shadow that welcomes in the night. It is the drop below the horizon where a star sinks into surrender. Lightless. We will not allow such a fate. Not here.\"\n\nSister Faora takes a deep breath.\n\n\"We must remain vigilant if we are to protect all the Light has touched.\" The proselytizing figure steps from the lectern. \"You arrived only hours ago. Did you not, Brother? I believe I witnessed your arrival.\"\n\nHe did not think his presence worth noting. \"I did my…\"\n\n\"Sister Faora, Superior.\"\n\n\"Of course, Sister.\" He should have known from her authoritative tone. \"I have come to learn.\"\n\n\"Then your first lesson is this: Listen. The choice to close their ears is what drove the City to fail. It is why we must conduct our work here. It is why without us, their walls will be for nothing.\"\n\nVance fell silent. Sister Faora let his submission linger and then continued.\n\n\"Each Risen Lightbearer, each Guardian is Light made flesh by the Traveler. They are Light, and Light is wielded. When we refuse to wield the Light as needed, we give ground to the Darkness.\"\n\nSister Faora looked out over her congregation.\n\n\"I'm sure many of you have grown curious as to what Light we could wield somewhere as desolate as this.\" Sister Faora allows herself a smirk and brief chuckle before inclining her head to the two Guardians now seated at the back of the chapel.\"\n\n\"It is here that we will stand against the second eclipse of the Traveler's Light. It is here that the Collapse shall begin anew, should we falter. I do not know when, only what is and will be.\"\n\nThey stared back at her, eyes full of conviction, faces bright with belief, hearts filled with assured direction. Their minds lacked nuance. Vance's chest swelled as he breathed in their stalwart faith coiled around sweetly smelling barks and spices that popped over torchlight.\n\n\"The spires of Mercury shall be filled with the glory of the Traveler. Their Light will shine against the long shadow when Darkness reaches to snuff out the Sun. Mercury will sing when day finds night, and we will direct it. These are Osiris's words, by his own hand. We followed the prophet here to facilitate his preparations for the second coming, whatever they may be.\"\n\nShe marinated in the energy of the chapel.\n\n\"We will learn how the Light here is to defeat the Darkness. This is what he has asked of us. These Lighthouses are our deliverance, and now my brothers and sisters… there is much work to do.\"\n\nThe herd stood in response to their shepherd, Vance among them."

        "text": "Entry 3\n\nMy days since arriving at this sanctuary have been blessed with acceptance and tranquility. Healthy debate regarding the Teacher's words is welcomed and appreciated. We all seek to understand the Light and the necessity for Darkness. Sister Faora has fawned over my interpretation of the texts. She said I could see what others could not. She has opened my mind to the consideration that my condition is a blessing rather than a curse. Time will tell.\n\nEntry 8\n\nOur peace was disrupted today by an assault from the warmongering Cabal at our doorstep. I was ushered to safety at the top of the spire by Leanna, one of our Warlock sisters. Without a moment's notice, she jumped straight into the fray and began to push our intruders back. During the battle, something strange occurred. Leanna was fighting near-insurmountable odds—based on the amount of ammunition I heard discharged—and she was overcome. Of course, she was resurrected by her Ghost, but the spire reacted. There was a hum; the timbre consisted of two distinct resonating tones—one smooth and warm, the other sharp and cold. I thought I could have imagined it through the ringing of gunfire, but it was most certainly there. It was almost imperceptible, and I thought merely a coincidence until it happened again. Eremac, the other Warlock and student of the Dawnblade, was also temporarily disposed of. The roar of the Colossus's slug launcher tearing through Eremac's flesh was unmistakable, but so was the tone that followed. I have to know more. We were able to withstand their incursion, but not without suffering a few casualties. Now we must prepare for a funeral, but my thoughts are dominated by that mysterious tone. Perhaps later, we can try to replicate it.\n\nEntry 12\n\nAfter explaining the phenomenon to Sister Faora, she has recruited the Warlocks to participate in thanatonautic death trials, in the hopes to recreate the hum and gain some clarity into its purpose. During these trials I had others accompany me to the top of the spire to see if they too could hear the tones. None were able to ascertain much—it seems one would need to be musically inclined or have some training—and the weight has fallen on me to decipher the code. I can't be sure of the intent, but I am certain of the cause. Every time one of our Warlocks sacrificed themselves, that same resonance would reverberate through my ears. What does it mean, and what purpose does it serve? Is the spire, in fact, an instrument? I need to expand my research further and see what tones this structure is capable of producing.\n\nEntry 22\n\nThrough countless debates, I have received permission to broaden the scope of my inquisition. We have designs to organize something more formal. Launching under the guise of a tournament or competition, we're leveraging contacts we've made to repurpose some weaponry as bounty. The Guardians are already killing themselves in Shaxx's Crucible. I proposed making our version more exclusive to draw out only the most adept fighters with the strongest connection to the Light. We can make them purchase entry to further fund our studies. They will literally pay for the privilege to kill each other for our \"rewards.\" I've stumbled onto something grand. I will do whatever it takes to get the answers I seek, just as Osiris would. Should he ever return, I imagine he will be quite proud and pleased to meet me."

        "text": "\"They're so eager to tear each other apart for guns and cloth.\" Brother Vance sighed.\n\nThe early Trials match ran its course. A Hunter, cloaked in light gray and clutching Drang, pressed one hand to a bullet wound in his gut and slumped into cover. He winced as his Ghost spun Light into the wound, slowly weaving flesh together and extracting the bullet. He checked the remaining ammunition in his sidearm. Two hostile Guardians stalked his position in pincer formation and pinned him with suppressing fire.\n\n\"Blood money runs cheap these days,\" Vance continued. He shifted toward the frame next to him. \"Don't you think, Cheska?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the presented motive is flawed.\" Ch3-5ka, a repurposed Redjack and assistant to Vance, had expressed hesitation about their endeavor. It had expressed hesitation about using its uplink to patch into the Crucible monitoring system. It had expressed hesitation about the strangely coded sub-routine running in the Lighthouse spire's architecture. Some level of anxiety, Vance would jab, was intrinsic to Redjack programming.\n\n\"In the Crucible, Lord Shaxx guides new Lights with positivity and—\"\n\nVance nodded for a moment before interrupting. \"Most Guardians care only for power and glory. That is what makes Osiris so unique. Meaning drives us. Understanding. Knowledge. These are the marks of our work's importance.\"\n\nGunshots rang through the arena's capture devices. Ch3-5ka's commentary singled in on the Hunter, last remaining of his fireteam. The Hunter twirled from their cover, propelled by a burst of Light, and flicked a tripmine grenade under the assailant on his left. The explosion killed her instantly, allowing the Hunter to shift and rattle off three rounds, Vance noted, toward his other opponent. One round struck the Guardian's helm and ricocheted off, splitting his visor.\n\n The Hunter squeezed the trigger again, which responded with an ineffectual click. The split-helm Guardian rushed him.\n\nThe sandy Lighthouse alcove they had repurposed as observation room was abuzz with Ch3-5ka's match analysis and an inconspicuous droning.\n\nThe Hunter dropped his sidearm and reached for a slung fusion rifle, but the rushing Guardian struck him solidly with a fist full of lightning. The droning hum shifted somewhat lower.\n\nVance straightened against his chair back at the frame's vibrant description of Guardians spinning deeper into ruthlessness. He could feel a crescendo hanging just moments ahead. He noted the resonant murmur undulating through his skin and into his bones.\n\nDowned and stunned, the Hunter struggled to stand. The split-helm Guardian towered above him, pulled a hand cannon, and slowly discharged. Every. Single. Chamber.\n\nThe hum spiked. \"Fireteam eliminated,\" Ch3-5ka stated blankly, though Vance could barely hear its words.\n\nThe victor stood over the Hunter's bullet-ridden corpse, and the Lighthouse sang to Vance. The Hunter's Ghost compiled into existence over his Guardian's body.\n\n\"Someone needs an attitude adjustment,\" the Ghost sneered.\n\nThe victorious Guardian craned his head toward the Ghost. He raised his hand cannon and sunk trigger to frame. The revolver's cylinder rotated, the hammer fell, and the piece gave off a heavy, empty click.\n\n\"Are you crazy?!\"\n\n\"Brother Vance. I believe a Ghost is in danger. It is against Sanction-C2-1 to harm a Lightbearer's Ghost.\"\n\nVance tuned the frame out, turning his ear instead to various audio playbacks from the match. He listened to distinguish gun caliber, Light affinity, and fireteam movements as the hum's tone changed. He traced them through sound cues and shouted, disembodied announcements. He pinpointed each variable for which he could account and directed Ch3-5ka to capture every analytic scrap.\n\nThe Guardian dropped a round into the cylinder and spun it lazily.\n\n\"Let's find out.\"\n\nThe Hunter's Ghost discharged a pulse of Light, blinding the Guardian and raising the Hunter. The risen Hunter swift-drew a cannon of Light, as if reactively defending his Ghost. He cracked off a single golden shot from his flame-licked weapon. The shot pierced its target and sent ash snaking into the air.\n\nThe Lighthouse played Vance a new song. It hummed, deeper than before. He took in the sensation as low bass rolled through his chest. The hums grew dull, darker, as if born from death. Vance sat straight up, spine rigid, with a wide smile on his face. He composed a harmony of similar tones in his mind, tracking their down-pitch trajectory with anticipation. He thought of Osiris, how his research had led him down less-traveled routes through less-practiced methods. The knowledge that Vance alone could interpret these tones focused his work and narrowed his inhibitions. Purpose persuades.\n\n\"Cheater,\" Ch3-5ka blurted out. \"Match-call misalignment.\"\n\nVance's response ducked the conversation to start his own.\n\n\"I heard the Light bend. The Lighthouse reached out to that Guardian when they died… and their Light reached back. They are harmonious.\"\n\nCh3-5ka picked up his line of thought, adding: \"Anomaly detected. There has been a transmission from the Lighthouse. Uplink time: 0.00019 seconds.\"\n\n\"A random artifact, nothing more. Conclude this match. Archive the recordings. There is much to do.\"\n\n\"Match-call misalignment.\"\n\n\"Of course. We cannot abide cheating. Give the match to the team with the incinerated one.\"\n\n\"If you believe that to be best.\"\n\nVance tilted his head at Ch3-5ka's biting tone. It was sharp, unlike the lathering hum of the Lighthouse, unlike peaceful static from the structure's sub-routine channels. The frame was starting to sound like Leanna. Her doubt.\n\n\"Deliver the prizes to the victors. You are no longer needed here.\""

        "text": "The condensation from the air vent dripped in a near-perfect 4/4 time signature, a slow metronome, behind Brother Vance's shoulder. He nodded to the rhythm while he waited.\n\n\"She'll see you now.\"\n\nHe felt more like a prisoner than an esteemed guest, but he also considered how rare the audience he'd garnered was. Vance expected the red carpet, or whatever the Awoken equivalent of that is, to be rolled out for him. The information he'd amassed would surely warrant such pomp and circumstance. Perhaps after their conversation the tone would shift. How could it not?\n\nThe Queen's Paladins escorted Brother Vance through the Reef's interconnected tunnels. It was musky and due for a cleaning as far as his nose could observe.\n\nHe always took note of the paths he'd traveled, a useful device in case of a need of escape. Two rights, a left, a doorway, a long hallway, six stairs, and another doorway. The air here was much clearer than Mercury; probably filtered, he assumed.\n\n\"The Queen of the Reef, Her Majesty, Mara Sov.\" Announced one of the Paladins in a rather boisterous manner. There were others in the room, Vance noted.\n\n\"My lady.\" Vance said, paying her the obeisance he felt she deserved, genuflecting before her grace.\n\n\"Speak,\" she commanded. Was he a dog to her?\n\n\"I was hoping this would be more of a conversation than a presentation.\" Vance replied. He felt this was already off on the wrong foot.\n\n\"I do not have time to converse. Do you have something for me or not?\"\n\n\"I have a great many things. Truths that must be acknowledged with ramifications reaching far beyond these walls. It requires your extraordinary insight.\"\n\n\"Then speak.\"\n\nVance curled his lip and let out a low sigh.\n\n\"You seek something in return?\" Queen Mara, perceptive as always.\n\n\"I do. The information I have is extremely sensitive and I ask the room be cleared until we've spoken.\"\n\nQueen Mara considered this, put her hand up, and locked eyes with Petra for a second. The room cleared out.\n\n\"We are alone. Say what you came to say.\"\n\n\"I've discovered something quite disturbing, yet wholly revelatory. As you know, we've been running the Trials for some time now. On Mercury there exists a spire, one of many, that we've called the Lighthouse. Inside, a two-toned note resonates whenever Guardian death occurs. It's a strange and almost imperceptible sound, but I hear it as clearly as I hear your voice today. The tone tells me…\"\n\n\"…that Guardians have dangerous potential within them.\"\n\n\"My Queen…\"\n\n\"Why do you think I allow you to stay here? You believe you have occupied my Reef without my knowledge of the studies you conduct?\"\n\n\"How did you…\" Vance was awestruck.\n\n\"We know this truth. We are Awoken. We are balance. Brother Vance, I would advise you to finish up your Trials with a defter hand and to destroy all records of your findings. You've stumbled onto something too grand in scale for your comprehension. Keep this to yourself.\"\n\nBrother Vance's head hung low, and his shoulders slumped.\n\n\"You know everything, and yet I have learned nothing beyond what I came here with. I would like some clarity.\"\n\nQueen Mara looked over Vance. While she didn't feel compassion toward him, his situation was unfortunate.\n\n\"Come closer.\"\n\nVance's head slowly returned upright. Did he hear her correctly?\n\n\"Closer, I said.\"\n\nVance took several steps up to her throne. The air around Mara seemed to shift—it was more elegant, crisp upon his tongue. Her words carried more cleanly through it, somehow.\n\n\"I cannot offer you any clarity. The Universe will reveal all when the time comes. There is, however, something you can do for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, anything.\" Vance was desperate to get back in her good graces.\n\nShe leaned in, whispering near his ear.\n\n\"When you see our friend…\""

To know my charge with such clarity is a divine offering. I alone have been receiving communications from the affectionately named Lighthouse. Not a single man, woman, or Guardian can interpret the complexity and nuance of the hums. The music of death. I always make sure to be near, so as not to miss a note. Each one brings a new revelation, answering a question, raising another.\n\nI am recognized within our congregation as well. \"Speaker of the Lighthouse\" they call me. A lofty and somewhat ironic title given the contemptuous feelings toward the heretic, but I'm honored nonetheless.\n\nFinally, I have chosen to decommission the frame Ch3-5ka. Its exhaustive knowledge could have compromised my standing in this matter. Queen Mara was correct in her assertion of the sensitivity of my work. Now, it is between me, the Queen, Osiris, and the Light and Dark itself. No more loose ends.\n\nEntry 63\n\nThe inevitable has occurred. For all their hubris and self-righteousness, they couldn't withstand the onslaught of the Red Legion. The Traveler's Light has been suppressed by Dominus Ghaul and his insurrection of the Tower. The timing was impeccable and offered me an insight I hadn't previously considered viable. Many lives were lost today in a barbarous skirmish across the Last City, but none as important as the life lost in our Trial. I believe Guardians have adopted the term \"final death\" for these such instances. A competitor was defeated at the precise moment the Light was stripped from him; his Ghost destroyed in the concussive blast from a pulse grenade. Then, the most marvelous phenomenon occurred: The Lighthouse spoke to me but changed its key. A D-sharp minor, if I'm not mistaken. Previously, I had been presented with only a harmonious two-toned note; the implications, as I made clear to Queen Mara Sov, could not be overlooked. Today, I am presented with a defining note that substantiates my theory and validates everything our founder stood for.\n\nWhen I speak now, everyone should listen, for I alone hold the truth. As it stands, I have no further use for the Trials and will be discontinuing the tournament indefinitely. I have what I came for. All I need now is council."

Your dedication, wisdom, and passion inspire me and reinvigorate my bourn.\"\n\n\"No, great Osiris. It is you who inspired me to become the man you see before you. Together we can change the world.\"\n\nThis was anything but that moment.\n\n\"You've wrapped your mind around an idea of your own making. I have always tolerated this fawning 'movement' of yours, but this is a step too far.\" Osiris seethed. Brother Vance was awestruck.\n\nHe stared blankly at Osiris, unsure of what he could say to quell his anger and dissolve his frustration.\n\n\"What I have discovered…\"\n\n\"…is dangerous enough to destroy every man, woman, and child in existence. You're meddling with forces outside your grasp,\" Osiris reprimanded. \"I warn you here and now, remove yourself from this Lighthouse. Find a simple life. Start a family. Write music. Leave Mercury and this fool's errand behind.\"\n\nVance considered this.\n\n\"I thought you would be proud…\"\n\nOsiris's sullen grumble told him otherwise.\n\n\"If you hold weight to my words at all, you will honor them. Your duties will be assumed by another.\"\n\nVance's chest felt as if an avalanche had occurred, a cavalcade of dread filled his lungs. He turned away from the man he'd admired for so long, speechless and demoralized. Standing in front of the Mercurial vista before him, overwhelmed and listening—the lush marigold sand slopes sweeping over themselves with each breeze, rushing radiolarian fluid cascading down Vex emplacements, the distant pulsing of an unclaimed patrol beacon. His back now to the structure that once inspired him with its song. It mocked him with a deafening silence. How could he have miscalculated this erroneously?\n\nOsiris felt a pang of pity for Vance, but had greater matters to attend to, and left without offering a farewell.\n\n\"That was rough,\" Sagira sneered. \"But he was right. Everything he discovered… the implications…\"\n\n\"I know,\" Osiris admitted remorsefully. \"Which makes this situation all the more precarious.\"\n\n\"Osiris! Wait!\" Brother Vance came vaulting out of the Lighthouse at breakneck pace.\n\n\"Here we go.\"\n\n\"Hush, Sagira.\"\n\n\"Queen Mara Sov… wanted me… to tell you…\" Vance struggled to catch his breath. \"She wanted me to tell you, 'plant the seed.'\"\n\nOsiris studied Vance quizzically.\n\n\"I don't know what she means, but she said you would.\" Vance offered, apologetically.\n\n\"I believe I do,\" Osiris replied, placing his hand on Vance's still-heaving shoulder. \"Thank you. This is quite useful. Well done.\"\n\nWith that, Osiris departed.\n\nVance listened as the Sails of Osiris took off, the pungent smell of burning fuel from its turbine engine clogging his nostrils, and repeated to himself, \"Well done,\" with a slight smile breaking across his lips."

Textured notes and schematics derived from Osirian lore guided his hand. He heard stories from passing Guardians of increasingly frequent coronal mass ejections. Vast bursts of charged particles whipped into space and furled around a gravitational monster buried from sight and sense in the roar of the star-wind. Passage to Mercury had become more dangerous for the uninitiated. These unnatural motions were heralds of speculation, and he had read the signs.

What worth have I ever been, except that I know the enemy?\n\n(More worth, Mara would remind me. I am more than my uses.)\n\nSo:\n\nWhat bird would we become if we left the Traveler behind?\n\nThere are obvious examples. We might survive as raiders on the edge. We might abandon our humanity for machines. We might rise up in war and build an empire.\n\nYet none of these can be the answer. Fallen, Vex, Cabal, and Hive all covet the Traveler. They have not left it behind.\n\nIf all things beyond the Traveler's protection fall under the suzerainty of Darkness—not because they serve it but because they are obedient to its law—then to leave the Traveler would be to join the enemy. There would be no other way.\n\nEven so, I am proof otherwise. I move between. There is not only grey between black and white; all the colors are there. And am I not necessary? I would be lost without those who led me back to the Light, but if I had not been there to guide them down into Darkness, they would all be dead…\n\nWho would we become if we were all like Eris Morn?\n\nAh—my wok is on fire—"

In one, she relives Twilight Gap.\n\nShe lunges, driving a sword into the belly of a Guardian-soldier, grunting as they yell and crumple forward. Another Guardian rushes at her head-on before she has time to yank the Sword free. But she hears the sound of a Shock Rifle firing behind her… and leans abruptly to the right as the shot flies by and hits the Guardian before her with full force.\n\nShe looks back to see Kridis, shimmering with the purple glow of the Void as her Servitor shields her. Kridis tips her head in acknowledgement of Eramis and turns to fire the rifle into another cluster of Guardians.\n\nEramis rips her Sword free and forges ahead. They are closing in on the city now. Guardians are falling all around her. \n\nThey are so close.\n\nFast, heavy footfalls come up behind her—Phylaks, ferocious and bloodthirsty, shouts to Eramis as she attacks a towering, broad-shouldered Guardian. Eramis ducks and slides out of the way. As Phylaks makes contact with the Guardian's head, Eramis slashes the beast across his side with her Sword. He loses his balance, and she kicks his hip, tipping him toward Phylaks.\n\nIn these days, Phylaks almost always fights with her bare hands. She breaks his neck.\n\nEramis pushes forward.\n\nThey are so close…\n\nA ferocious laugh erupts to her right, and then the thundering blast of a Scorch Cannon. Taniks, a blur of whirring machinery, creates explosions of earth and flesh and blood all around them. He keeps laughing.\n\nSo close.\n\nBut then… before her, a blinding flash of gold. She sees Eliksni burst into flame and ash around her as a gun fires one shot after another. Pools of shining light are the only trace of the victims. The Guardian wielding the gun is like a tiny sun.\n\nAnother shot. Kridis's Servitor. Another—Kridis herself. Eramis remembers losing, but she does not remember this. Doesn't remember seeing Phylaks evaporate into blowing ash. Doesn't remember the shot that hits her in the chest, or the burning fire that explodes through her limbs, or her own scream…\n\nShe wakes with a jolt, breathless."

Their fetid stench is unbearable, worse than the carcass piles at the prison, worse than the battlefield of Twilight Gap. They eat and breathe death, and she resents their breath upon her, so she cuts through them like so much tall grass. \n\nA Knight stalks her deep into the catacombs, staying on the edge of her hearing, matching her footsteps.

Power that she can grasp.\n\nBut not yet.\n\nA waking dream strikes her like lightning. She's transported. The bleak, gray dust of the Moon falls away, and she stands in a white plain of whipping ice and snow.

Out in the Reef, ruins are as much landmarks as planets and moons. The flotsam of derelict colony ships from the Golden Age flood the atmosphere along with the ruined hulks of Hive ships from campaigns fought against the Awoken. For the Eliksni, finding the wreckage of a Ketch is like finding the ruins of a family home, and all the emotions that come with it. But the societal scars of Eliksni clans have long since vanished, and for those who bend a knee to the Spider in the remote corner of the Reef known as the Tangled Shore, they have lost the privilege of such sentimentality.\n\nA salvage crew was dispatched the week after a small scouting party from the Spider's personal fiefdom spotted the wreckage of a Ketch belonging to the lost House of Kings. The crew chief on the operation, an ambitious Vandal named Kosis, had shed her attachments to a life within that very house years ago. But the choice to leave something behind and the act of doing so are two entirely different things.\n\nKosis insisted first on surveying the wreck herself, alone, before allowing her team near it. They were to take anything with even a shred of value after unceremoniously cutting the vessel from bow to stern. As they marked it for dissection, she watched them from a nearby escarpment. She looked around and carefully revealed the small bundle of vestiges she personally salvaged from the Ketch: a ceremonial washing bowl, a child's musical instrument, and the cracked ceramic effigy of a Servitor. Kosis covered them with a tattered cloth the color of the setting sun—branded with the symbol of a house she no longer called hers—and buried them.\n\nIt was the only dignity this ship would receive."

The Dregs begrudgingly established guard posts on overlooks surrounding the camp, with nighttime sentry rotations to match, and the crew's scrap-work Shank orbited the site on alarm mode.\n\nSavek seethed as she and the other Dregs dug out their guard posts. These precautions were meant to deter competing parties from biting the crew's claim, but it was a waste of energy this far out. The foreboding quiet would betray any approaching Pikes.\n\nOnce camp was established, each crew member received an Ether ration commensurate with their station. Savek tried not to hunger as she watched Kosis inhale three full portions of the life-giving essence; more than twice her own share. The Spider had given them just two tanks—partly as a cost-saving measure, and partly as an incentive to get the job done quickly.\n\nLater that night, a crewmate woke Savek from her deep slumber. \"You're late. Northwestern posting. Two-cycle shift,\" the Dreg grumbled. Savek clicked her mandibles in irritation and trudged wearily into the deep violet gloaming of the Shore.\n\nSavek was nestled in her dugout at the top of a wide dune, trying not to fall back asleep, when she heard a faint whisper. An urgent, familiar call from the far side of the dune, away from camp. Savek bolted upright. Maybe someone wandered away from camp. Or maybe, she thought subversively, someone secured a portion of Ether and needs an accomplice. The latter possibility sent her scuttling down the dune.\n\nWhen she reached the bottom of the slope, she found herself alone. Yet the beckoning whisper persisted, voluminous as an explosion and gentle as a caress. It came from a rocky cave no larger than Servitor.\n\nSavek drew her rusted Shock Pistol, clicked on her light, and peered into the cave.

Where once only darkness filled the space within its frame, a hint of sickly green light now shone. Tendrils of smoke wafted from the apertures, as though it were an incense brazier.\n\nKosis immediately strode forward and assessed the nodule crowning the surface of the barren rock. As the Vandal knelt beside the structure, she saw deformed latticework-like veins protruding through and eroding the stone, as though the object was grown rather than constructed. Kosis waved the Dregs over.\n\nPressure began to build inside her head, behind her eyes, as the ground rumbled. They sprang back, away from the structure; the artifice sprang to life in turn. It twisted its way out of the ground, spiraling upward and outward, spreading open like a terrible biomechanical flower. Only when the eruption halted did Kosis feel the pressure in her head recede.\n\nIt was undeniably of Hive origin, but Kosis had never seen anything of the sort. This implication, this realization—perhaps this was novel to the Spider as well. If that were true, this piece of \"living\" Hive technology would be worth more than Ether.

Maddeningly complex armatures were contained within, lubricated by gristly, living tissue.\n\nKosis had marked the Hive salvage specifically for the Spider's attention. It wouldn't be shipped off to marketplaces and storehouses like the remains of the Ketch—finds like this were of special interest to him. Kosis considered sending a missive ahead of the shipment but thought better of it. If she weren't there to present the find herself, another ambitious Vandal or Dreg might try and take the credit. Spider would probably promote the usurper strictly out of appreciation for their cunning.\n\nKosis was so focused on ensuring the safety of her salvage that she hadn't noticed Savek and the other Dregs running into camp from the direction of the cave. Kosis stood, Sword in hand, half-expecting a mutiny. But from the fear in Savek's eyes, Kosis quickly realized it was anything but.\n\n\"It returned!\" was all Savek could exclaim. The Dregs confirmed: the dismantled structure had regrown in a matter of hours. Kosis ordered the trio to lead her back to the site, to see it with her own eyes. A part of her yearned to see it again.\n\nMuch to Kosis's disbelief, their assertion was true. The structure stood as tall as ever, emanating its hideous green light. A pang of dread shook Kosis to the core. Her mind flooded with memories of childhood stories about the Whirlwind and the onslaught of the Hive.\n\n\"Leave it,\" she ordered. \"Leave it and do not return.\" It was a command, though one born of fear.\n\nThe tower whispered an unheard counteroffer into her subconscious.\n\n<<Come.>>\n\n<<See.>>"

        "text": "The Ketch that once belonged to the House of Kings lay on its side now, the vessel's underbelly stripped down to the curving superstructure supports. A half-kilometer of power cabling spooled out from the middle of ship, forming a path that lead to the salvage team's tents. From the escarpment overlooking the salvage site, the Ketch looked like the disemboweled remains of some great beast.\n\nKosis wondered, as she sipped on a hand-tank of Ether, if this is what her people had become. Carrion birds to the rotting carcasses of their society. She wondered how many more generations of Eliksni it would take before the old ways were entirely forgotten. If any Eliksni born today would know how to play the instrument now buried on the overlook.\n\nWould her daughters be proud of how she had chosen to survive? She wondered where their bones were scattered. Wondered if they suffered when the House of Kings was torn apart.\n\nThe sound of footsteps pulled Kosis from her thoughts. She affixed her Ether flask to her belt and rose to greet whomever was coming. It was Savek. Alone. \"Your shift isn't over,\" Kosis firmly reminded the Dreg.\n\nSavek lunged forward with a Sword—Kosis's own weapon, stolen from her tent. She sucked in a breath, which might have exited her as a cry of confusion had the Dreg not buried the Sword hilt-deep in her throat. Ether sprayed into the air, comingling with blood.\n\nThe blade ground against her spine as she slid, helpless, down the length of the Sword. As she fell to the ground, her vision tunneled dark, her extremities numb. Savek screamed a primal and unfathomable wail.\n\nThe Vandal's last thoughts were of the Kell of Kells.\n\nThen, nothing."

        "text": "Savek supplicates before the obelisk. It looms over her, listing from the cave entrance into the bruise-colored sky. Its black metal surface writhes and undulates like wormflesh. It whispers of victory and transcendence.\n\n<<To claim evolution one must be unmade.>> \n\nThe throb of Ether courses through her prone form. She can feel the longing itch of her arm stumps that yearn for regrowth. Sickly sweet Ether leaks from her body, mixing with that of her crewmates.\n\n<<Flesh and mind are but cages—become unbound, or remain ever unworthy.>> \n\nSavek's claws dig convulsively into the grainy dirt as her body ruptures. Her skin gives a grisly rip as her viscera expands beyond its confines. The thick glow of Ether is joined by another more ravenous force. Plasm spurts from connective tissue as her body swells, molting and regrowing in an eruption of chitin.\n\n<<Your prison of the flesh is being unmade, your mind freed—such glories do not come easy.>> \n\n<<Allow the flesh to give of itself, that it may surrender to the coming evolution.>> \n\nThere, kneeling before her new god, Savek's mind is broken and remade in continuous motion. She watches as her memories are deconstructed into images without association. She observes her identity dissected into the unknowable motives of a stranger. She watches herself transform from She into It.\n\n<<You will know—through the pain, through the fear—there is no longer a you that was, only what comes next, and all the pain to follow.>> \n\n<<As the old self falls away there will be only suffering.>> \n\nIt raises its head for the first time, and finds the tower likewise transformed. The black spire opens like a birthing cavity, yawing forth a new realm. The breach draws the creature into a massive cathedral hall with malachite suns roiling overhead. Here, the whispers are all-consuming.\n\n<<As the old self falls away there will be only suffering.>> \n\n<<There will be only suffering.>> \n\n<<Only suffering.>>"

We need to control this, study the arm. If he's going to die anyway, maybe we just amputate and pair the arm with another patient.\n\n[J.W.] But we don't currently have any other… Oh.\n\n[C.B.] Wouldn't you like to have a shiny new arm?

        "text": "This page is blighted with mold and the imprint of a memory…\n\nThe words seep experience into your open mind…\n\nTHROUGH THE EYES OF KATABASIS…\n\nA royal invitation got me as far as the inner reliquary. I enter the belly of the Leviathan, unattended. My eyes catch on the runs in Calus's crestfallen banners. His inner halls don't gleam—reminds me of stories from the Golden Age. Polish the veneer and present them on a platter, but when you peel back the layers it's just… old. Past, with prime far behind.\n\nAhead, a Legionary in loyalist gild nods to me and swings open a door. A manufactured version of Calus stands tall on the other side. Its likeness mirrors the Tribute Hall's automaton and many other statuesque bots I'd spoken to him through.\n\nThe statue of Calus whines to life. \"You're early, but I suppose your tribe is always ahead of the pack, Hunter. Should I have this room moved, that you may stroll the Leviathan's halls that much longer and appreciate my hospitality?\"\n\nI'm not sure what he wants to hear. \"She's an impressive beast. I've come to take the job.\" I turn it like an offer.\n\nUncomfortable silence.\n\n\"Come and see me, Katabasis. I have a gift for you.\"\n\nThe statue points toward a domed chamber; its curled walls sport every kind of trophy. Bones on hooks. Taxidermy wrapped around terrified eyes and final moments.\n\nA clutch of Councilors watches me as they take mechanical plates from three other identical statues of Calus surrounding them. They huddle about a towering cage of filigreed alloys and woven circuitry, fitting the plates to it with sacramental focus, until the cage becomes a tomb around a pearlescent seat supporting a lonesome figure within.\n\n\"What an auspicious early arrival. Come. Witness my containment. Few have seen this,\" Calus wheezes from inside the cage, his voice like taut suffocation.\n\nCalus's withering form swells and jostles. My thoughts stink of disgust, and he can smell it. \"I am no more trapped here than you are by your Light. You assume this flesh satisfies me? How small. My automatons stand as monuments of my image; reflections of my breadth. They are, as I am: one collective self, as Nothing is.\n\nI grit my teeth and look on, stepping sideways to see him from a different angle. His skin is mottled with sickly translucence that grips my stomach.\n\n\"Your thoughts are as open as your fears, Katabasis. Come, come…  look upon me and let my Councilors assuage them.\"\n\nCouncilors lay more thick plates over Calus's living misery, brushing past me as they finish and exiting the room with my inhibitions. Mechanisms within the plates engage as plum light emits from the slits between them. Nacre runs smooth around the frame and into a throne-like cup of sullied nobility. Beneath the throne, hoses bubble viscous royal wine into the sealed frame. Calus looks through me, eyes like clumped chalk, as the last Councilor fastens a faceplate into position. Deep orbs illuminate in the faceplate, like wild eyes in the open pitch of night. We are alone.\n\n\"What do you know of lies, Katabasis?\"\n\nI pick between the words. \"There're a lot different kinds.\"\n\n\"And all of them are weakness. \" Calus's voice spills from the containment vessel and floods the room. \"Gods do not lie. Like me, they have neither the capacity nor the reason. True power cannot be threatened. It does not compel deception. And yet, I have been betrayed by one I thought to be the final divinity.\"\n\n\"Sounds like you got swindled… ?\" I quickly blunt the question with respect: \"…Emperor?\"\n\n\"When the Darkness found me adrift in the cosmos, rejected by a people I had made, I thought to have found a confidant. No—an idol. They promised to return to me, to uplift me—that we may dance together among the stars and drink of their dying ecstasy 'til the end, as one. But their chilling little fleet came and went. It was luscious, and so many tasted so much. Yet I am empty. Nothing. Trapped in this limbo of their lie.\"\n\n\"And gods don't lie,\" I proffer.\n\n\"Precisely. To be seen…\" Calus pauses to heap the drama, \"…for what we really are, underneath the surface, is bliss.\" All four statues step forward to bear Calus's vessel. His voice resounds from all of them simultaneously. \"Come. Cast a shadow in my halls and drink. Soon we will speak to the liar, and separate from it the truth.\"\n\n\nFRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Smuggler's switches still working. Maintenance side-hatch. Had to kick in the vent."

Her eye hasn't left me since she boarded. To my right, a craggy Cabal Centurion, complete with demolition satchels and Projection Rifle, adjusts the connectors on his pressure suit. He'd been assigned to make sure none of the other Cabal try to kill me. Seems news of my command had rendered a number of the crew indignant.\n\nI prod first: \"I can't imagine hiding a ship from the Legion was easy on Nessus. To be honest, I'm surprised they haven't tried to storm the Leviathan.\"\n\n\"They would die,\" grumbles the Centurion. \"Bad strategy.\"\n\n\"What does it matter? Calus saw fit to give you a ship, Katabasis.\" My Ghost, Gilgamesh, glares at me.\n\nQinziq sneers and leans forward.

We disembark onto prickly milk-rich soil, turning away from the sun as the deep green sky slowly bleeds out. A congested Cabal shipyard glows in the distance against the crest of dark riding the horizon.\n\n\"You are Katabasis.\" The Cabal is speaking to me. He gestures to himself. \"Bahr'Toran.\"\n\n\"You're my skull-cracker.\" I point to my Ghost. \"Name's Gilgamesh, or Gilly.\"\n\nBahr'Toran considers for a moment and nods. \"I do that. But you will need to know my name if we find battle.\"\n\n\"I'm not looking to have a shootout with an entire base. I think the plan is more a quiet reappropriation of goods, Bahto.\"\n\n\"I do not like that.\"\n\n\"Gilly's didn't take at first, but time wears ya down.\"\n\nGilly nods to Bahto, who nods back with a grunt and begins walking. We follow him across the bluffs toward the yard, into flatland desolace and sunless gloom.\n\nThe shipyard is a massive pulverized flat of rough tarmac and shanty barracks surrounded by a barrier fence. It overflows with craft ranging across eras of the Cabal Empire. On the far end of the strip, Gilly spots Arc-lights shining. A figure draped in azure raiment stands above a throng of Cabal, drawing attention like thunder. Whatever he's saying, they believe it. Gilly catches a few words. It's the same talk you hear anywhere else someone's been forgotten: blame, looking for a hole to fester in; wrestling at the edges with tepid hope; at risk of falling back down into the past.\n\n\nFRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Maintenance hall off the cargo bay door.

Qinziq points to it, a Cabal carrier-class warship. \"Glykon Volatus.\" She touches her finger to the yard's perimeter barrier and says, \"Over,\" as if directing an animal. Qinziq flattens her palm against the ground and displaces the radiolarian saturation with a bubble of Void energy. It bursts and launches her and Bahto over the barrier. I follow on steps of Light, my Tex Mechanica rifle dangling from a loose strap.\n\nBahto settles last on uneasy jet bursts. Qinziq steps in front of him and calibrates a device on his chest plate before Bahto turns to face me. \"One of your transmat,\" he grumbles. \"I will stop their signal receiver, so our ship is hidden until we remove its locational anchor.\"\n\nWe separate into the silent yard, to our tasks. Qinziq and I weave through a field of parked interceptors as Bahto does his best to stay inconspicuous on his way to a gargantuan signal dish at the adjacent edge of the yard.\n\nThe daunting bow of the Glykon Volatus looms, obstructing the sky like a bloodied wave rearing up to consume us. I duck behind the frontal landing gear while Qinziq opens a service chute to the command deck.\n\nI peek through the open hatch. Down the hall, a lone Psion runs diagnostics on the bridge. I carefully crawl inside and slip the long rifle from my back.\n\n\"Shoot it.\"\n\n\"Guns are loud, Gil.\" He wasn't totally off-kilter. One thought from that Psions could alert the whole yard.\n\n'Ignorance.' The word ripples through my brain in Qinziq's seething voice. 'She will not.'\n\nI didn't invite you in here, I thought.\n\nThe ripple spreads: 'Yours is a mind unfocused and taxed. Chaos where reason should lie.'\n\n\"We need this ship,\" Gilly whispers. He swings into my peripheral view. \"If you don't do something, that Psion is going to have every Cabal in the sector on us!\"\n\nQinziq surfaces from the hatch and kneels beside us. \"This is Yirix, Ghost. She will not reveal us.\"\n\n\"She's Red Legion. Calus would see her executed.\"\n\n\"Psions fly many colors, but within the Cabal, we exist in congress, moving toward our own future. She will recognize my contribution, as I hers,\" Qinziq says, stepping forward.\n\nGilly watches Qinziq approach the other Psion. \"If this sours, don't give it the chance.\"\n\nHis words cinch around my lungs. Short breaths of wary anticipation escape. I sight my long gun and wait.\n\nYirix stiffens as she becomes aware of Qinziq. She turns. They bow their heads together. The two empathize and come to one understanding in silence.\n\nWhatever ambitions they have go further than this ship, this moment, this Cabal. I hadn't thought that way since I last wore the veneer of a Guardian. Sold a dream of an immortal City shielded by Light, as if it could go on forever. Forever is just a hope folks don't live long enough to see crumble.\n\nYirix looks to Gilly and me, to my rifle, unthreatened. I feel her request for temperance and a tranquil reassurance of their cause. For a moment, I feel young. I stand.\n\nWe warm the launch engines as Yirix slips away to join the throng and let us be.\n\nBahto materializes onto the bridge out of transmat and out of breath. He manages a few prideful words, \"Charges set. We will not be tracked.\"\n\nThe Glykon breaks atmosphere as a colossal explosion rocks the shipyard and shutters through our hull.

A microcosm of violence extrapolated to the world beyond, with only one escape. Soon Katabasis would know it too.\n\nScorn onlookers surround us.\n\nI raise Katabasis.\n\n\"Gilly…\" Katabasis kneels before me, his rifle beside him. \"What is this?\"\n\n\"A way out. I won't carry you anymore.\"\n\n\"You're… abandoning me?\" Katabasis looks to the Scorn, his rifle, his Ghost—no. No longer. Not his, not the Traveler's, not anyone's.\n\n\"I sacrificed everything to keep you moving forward. Guided you to every power you needed to survive.\" I share the truth he wants to forget. \"And for what? It never ends anything. There's always more.\"\n\nThe Scorn encroach across disjointed walkways. Katabasis sinks. \"You said you wouldn't…\"\n\n\"You, the Traveler. You've kept me trapped in this death knell. Now it's time to set us free.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" His words like stone weights.\n\n\"Sever our Light, or they'll rip you apart for a thousand lives.\" I gesture to the Scorn.\n\n\"You wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Your deaths are heavy, Katabasis, but I'll bring you back as many times as it takes for you to learn.\" He does not understand. \"You think I don't feel pain? You think I don't suffer while you're hiding in your limbo?\"\n\nKatabasis lurches forward. \"I did everything YOU asked me to.\"\n\n\"YOU LEFT!\" I shout. \"You left me here. You left me in the City. Made me turn away from the Traveler. We're like the Scorn in those tanks, drowning in panic… confusion… forever. You did that.\"\n\n\"The City was burning, and I wanted to live. Everything was… so we could live.\"\n\nHe still didn't see it. This place is no different than Sol. A barrel of blood. There's no reason to go back. \"Now the Light is burning.\"\n\n\"We can survive this.\" Katabasis holds out his palm for me. \"Please?\"\n\n\"I don't want survival, Katabasis.\" I drift away from him. \"I want salvation.\"\n\n\"…It got to you,\" Katabasis sobs weakly, his epiphany complete.\n\n\"You can end this, for both of us. It's your turn to sacrifice,\" I offer.\n\n\"Everything you say is a lie!\" Katabasis grasps for his rifle.\n\nLever-to-action.\n\nShot to nothingness.\n\nGhost to dead memory.\n\n\nFRENETIC SCRAWL INKED IN THE MARGIN READS: Water under the bridge, flooded with bodies waiting to stand again in the next wave.

Rather, I am dedicating my efforts to the understanding of this peculiar force the Guardian has stumbled into.\n\nIt is unknown to our local hosts, so they have been of limited help. Green energy returns few helpful results in accessible Vanguard databases—there are some limited notes on Weapons of Sorrow, of course, and Hive magics have a distinctive yellowish-green hue, but the quality of the visible effect is different. As is, naturally, the effect.\n\nBut, all the same, it is not a power of the Light. Their Ghost was certain about that. \n\nTo sum up what is known:\n\n• This power manifests with a specific symbol-set: green, thread or strings, knots. It is worth noting that there never seems to be a single thread, but rather a collection of them, whether in parallel or in tangle.\n\n• This power carries an impressive capacity for destruction, but causes a sort of rebound or exhaustion, the nature of which is not fully clear. It has not yet appeared lethal to the self, but it is being wielded by a Guardian fully empowered. Lethality means little in that context if it does not strike the Ghost as well, which this does not.\n\n• The Guardian is the only one who has wielded this power to date. One sample is insufficient to draw full conclusions about the capacity required in a wielder. We certainly know by now that no existing power of Light is required to use a power of Darkness, only willingness to participate in the required rituals…\n\n• The Guardian reported a sense of connection, a perception of the greater whole. I include this as relevant, more than likely related to the concept of multiple strings.\n\n• We do not yet know enough.\n\nThe enemies here on Neptune have put significant effort into inhibiting known paracausal powers. This new one may be precisely what is needed to gain an upper hand and keep it. But something uncontrolled and unknown, the nature of which is not yet fully understood, is unwise to wield indiscriminately.\n\nI could return to someplace the source of this energy has been reported and seek to touch it myself, but… I hesitate. I do not know why.\n \nPractical study via the Guardian first. Ontological and paracausal study once the current trouble has been dealt with."

Step here and punch there, and the threads are humming, harmony becoming warning becoming discord as the Titan realizes she doesn't know which way to leap.\n\nFire snakes toward her, and a heavy shield comes around, and all the threads slip away.\n\nShe misses a few moments in oblivion. The next thing she knows, her Ghost is hunkered close, a vibrant touch of Light pulling her up to a whole body, a hale mind. The sense of potential still thrums there, a heartbeat under the surface, a promise in the net of battle.\n\nDesperately, the Titan scrabbles for it again, but strands break in her grasp—the Legion is too close, and she wants too much, too fast. It's going to take too long to breathe and find again that perfect harmony she had. To say nothing of reaching for the Light—her nerves are rattled, her mind blank.\n\nThe Colossus remaining charges up his cannon. Her Ghost bumps against her helm, and she takes the only action she can think of: she flees, Ghost cupped in her hand and her favorite sword melted useless on the city street behind them."

        "text": "We are calling this power \"Strand.\" The threads of the world as it is woven, if the conscious universe could be considered to be a tapestry. Further analysis and data have suggested that the wielder of Strand begins to see, simply put, connections. Between allies, between enemies. It is a force that is always present, but wells to the surface more strongly in certain locations. Perhaps places many people think about, or where many beings have passed by. (Note: Analyze these \"sources\" in concert with the Cloud Strider. They may be able to provide more locational context.)\n\nThe true power of Strand lies not in the fact of the connection alone, but in the way such a power allows the manipulation of those connections. To make them something physical and then pull on it, or break it, or tie it into a knot. Or to unravel it entirely.\n\nStrand is not without danger, although that should not be unusual to Guardians. Those who take up the banner of Stormcaller, for instance, have their own storied contention with the storm, and the Void was unilaterally regarded as dangerous by the Vanguard for many years. Strand's danger comes from the very act of taking hold of those threads—like many powers, the closer one comes to the source, the more likely the source may act on the wielder.\n\nThis danger is no product of Darkness. Or rather, only insomuch as wildfires are a product of Light: a natural consequence. That aspect of Darkness which revels in destruction, which encourages the easy entropy for the pursuit of power—it is nowhere to be found here. It may not even be truly part of Darkness…\n\nI have touched Strand myself now. Carefully—I am too aware of mortality, but I must understand the power further if I am to hope to instruct the Guardian in turn. They acted as lightning rod while I experimented, and the backlash clung to them instead.\n\nWhat a strange feeling, to be so aware of one's size in the spectrum of existence! It is the natural instinct to try to steer that, to take any control at all, no matter how much. Whatever can be done to feel as though you are not wholly adrift, lost in something huge and all-encompassing.\n\nBut precisely at the moment one tries to grasp for control, the weave becomes a devouring snarl."

        "text": "Neomuna is a wonderful place for a Hunter to run. This Hunter, specifically.\n\nHere the activity of life runs close to the surface—like an invisible river, like a migration of birds, like the moment of breathless motion just before the lightning strikes. Here Strand twines through his fingers, strong as a rope and just as flexible, and all he has to do is keep running. And why would he ever want to stop?\n\nThe pounding of feet. The exhilaration of free-fall. The snap as he catches hold of the weave of existence itself and swings up again with all the momentum of his dive. In motion, as he turns, he catches brass and gold reflecting vibrant city lights, realizes there are Vex in the streets—\n\nAre they, too, part of the same flow? They echo in the weave nevertheless, like flowers on the surface of the rushing river. The Hunter bounds from one building to the next, never stopping, and finds effortlessly the place where all those Vex will converge, drops a roiling knot into the midst and sails on by.\n\nHow wonderful, simply to move, and never stop.\n\nAnd then, later: when the exhilaration has run its course and he's agreed to do some little work in the service of science, he perches at the top of Artifact's Edge, that towering drop-off on Nessus. There's a safe lift down, but no Hunter he knows has ever bothered to take it, rather bounding along in their free-fall, daredevil way.\n\nOn Neptune, in Neomuna where that artifact of Darkness shores up the existence of the city itself, finding the weave was easy. Here…\n\nHere on Nessus, it's perhaps not as close to the surface, but now he knows what he reaches for and, by the Darkness, it knows him as well. The Hunter wraps his hands in the beautiful ropes of the world's loom and vaults into emptiness. Laughter and Strand buoy him up at once, delight and freedom and a wonder at the vastness of existence.\n\nEasier to learn the trick of it, where the Veil is close and enveloping. But of course Strand is everywhere. How could it not be?"

        "text": "I have been conducting research among the local population, specifically regarding the \"children's story\" Nimbus told us, regarding the river of souls. I had a suspicion that there might have been other versions, or versions with better recorded provenance.\n\nWillingness to participate in this research has been mixed, as have the results. It seems to be an endemic concept rather than a religious belief, and no one has been able to say where it comes from, save that a parent or teacher told it to them at some point. Some respondents have mentioned a river of stars—perhaps the Milky Way galaxy—and some have cited windstreams and weather formations, but the majority of respondents adhere to the \"river of souls\" construct. \n\nAll things come from the river, and all return to it. The river may split and meet again. Other things may fall into it and change its course, but nevertheless it continues. In time, even mountains are worn down before it. \n\nNaturally, it is easiest to view this as an allegory for control of life. In the end, rivers are impossible to control. A person may swim or boat, but never take hold of the river to steer the course of the water itself. And it is impossible not to see the relationship to Strand, which slips away the moment a person tries to grasp too tightly.\n\nI wonder about Strand. About its appearance. We can see the origins of the Stasis power on Europa, and the concept of a cosmic ice to oppose stellar fire fits very neatly in a certain sort of paradigm. Even that idea of stillness and control suits freezing, a slowness of atoms whether or not it is in truth a power of \"ice.\" There is a certain weight to the perception of an \"element.\"\n\nIf Strand had been shaped through the lens of Neomuna, surely it should have been some cosmic water instead, something that flows and gives way only to rise again. There are certainly combat styles to support this in old records.\n\nBut this power that has never before been used in this way came to one Guardian first, and I conjecture that they may have unconsciously given it form. I wish I had seen it! What would \"connection\" have appeared as? Now, of course, we know the shape of this power: it is green, it weaves itself in strings. As other Guardians begin to learn it, they too slot it into these positions in their minds. Whatever advances they come to are already framed verdant and tangling.\n\nAll the same, I cannot help but wonder about the nascent, formless thing it was before we reached out to it, and it reached back."

        "text": "The Warlock sits with hands in the water and hums to themself. Several of the local feral pouka come and go as time passes, bumping up against fingers or vaulting out of the water to become airborne and curious, spattering drops everywhere. The Warlock doesn't mind, really. It's impossible to feel alone when dozens of creatures are hanging on their every move.\n\nPerhaps meditation is meant to be solitary, but this is comforting.\n\nA year ago, they were running with a fireteam, a tight-knit group of six that had each other's backs. Till the stars died, the lot of them had thought. It would always be like this.\n\nNow there is one Warlock sitting in a flock of pouka, in an impossible settlement on a miraculous planet. And they miss that sense of companionship desperately—\n\nThere's something besides water in their hands. Cautiously, wonderingly, they lift their hands out of the pool and find green. The same verdancy as Strand, the same parallel strings and helical shifts. Only this also seems to be something living? \n\nIt skitters over their hand, up their arm to their shoulder, leaving the sense of warmth in its wake. The Warlock stays very still as the little Strand-creature brushes against their cheek and then simply vanishes, a lingering hint of green and a sense of company the only concept that it was there in the first place.\n\nThe pouka congregate around shortly after, all chirps and flaps, and the Warlock can't help but laugh, even as they shoo some of the creatures away. They're supposed to be meditating.\n\nBut they didn't really come here to be alone. And it was foolish to think that they ever could be, when connected to the web that living creatures spin between them all. The Warlock breathes deep and dips their hands into the water again, and the pouka and the little green moments of connection swarm about them.\n\nAll might not be well, but it is better, like this. Not alone. Never truly alone, in this wide world where everything is bound together."

        "text": "Despite being aware by now of the correct manner to practice Strand—a loose hand, a letting-go of the concept that it can be controlled—some things still elude me. The will to let go at all, for instance.\n\nIt is pure foolishness, of course, to think that letting go of the need to control this one thing will extend to all areas of my life. A ceding of control in a game of chess does not translate to the same in philosophy. And yet it is true that people are not discrete, disconnected systems; they are many interlinked systems. One facet adjoins the next. \n\nI think of spinning. It has been a long, long time since any raw fiber passed my hands, but there were times in the Dark Age when if anyone wanted cloth, it must be made from scratch. Fleece is shorn, then carded out to remove the imperfections and align the fibers. And when you have them, what then? A single fiber is short and fragile. It breaks if you tug even lightly. It is useless.\n\nBut twist many of those short fibers together, and they become useful. Weavable, or knittable, or what-have-you. Thus, is strong cloth made: from the most delicate of things.\n\nI think of spinning, and I remember the way unspun fiber passes through the fingers to the spindle. One pinches, but not too hard, just enough to direct and narrow. Too much and the fiber does not pass, the spinning does not take.\n\nThe metaphor is transparent. Obviously, this is about Strand. Just as it is about a craft I used to know, long ago. Beginner's errors can only be solved by learning the shape of failure, but most yarns will not unravel the spinner if some mistake is made.\n\nAnd I am afraid. Not only of death, of wasting that final sacrifice Sagira made to preserve my life. But that if I open my hand, I will find it no longer hurts, that the thorn I have imagined there for so long is already gone.\n\nIt is all the same thing, in the end. I think I must be willing to let go, to let that which is truly temporary sink beneath the water, in order to achieve any significant capacity with Strand. Even pain may be guarded jealously, as though it is a treasure, but it need not be.\n\nHow fascinating what the lens of Strand shows us about Darkness."

        "text": "Osiris contemplates the universe.\n\nStrand curls between his fingers, a gentle presence, shape shifting but not changing. A helix—a careful knot, like those that used to be artwork—a braid. Always strands, always a structure that creates strength from fragility. \n\nHe is so aware of the beat of his heart, in ways he never used to be. It shudders in his chest, aching but resolute.\n\nHe knows where the closest people are—the Guardian, obvious, within eyesight and hovering fretfully just in case Osiris slips. Nimbus, further away but tangible, probably surveying the city outside. And there's a pouka he can't quite see somewhere behind him, making eddies in the flow of the Strand as if it can dive into and out of that just as well as water or air.\n\nIt would be so easy to close his hand, to take hold of that which he touches. He does not. He thinks about it—lets his fingers curl softly—holds there as the humming cords of the world's loom shiver around him.\n\nExistence flows. It is not a stagnant thing, one snapshot in time. In these connections, there is always motion, and all things are swept away in time, good and bad. No wonder Strand unravels, when it is given half a chance to do so; as far as it is concerned—if it has any sentience at all—everything is simply part of the river, a momentary curve or splash.\n\nOsiris has known the vastness of the Infinite Forest and the great span of their solar system, and it is only here, with a tiny nascent spiral of the cosmic weft in his hand, that he feels small.\n\nAnd yet: he knows also that he is not alone. A hundred hundred steady threads weave together, pulling this way and that, flowing and twisting and always part of the greater whole.\n\nHe should be taking notes. Expanding the Vanguard's understanding of Darkness, simplifying the steps of learning Strand for Guardians new to paracausality.\n\nBut for a moment, Osiris is at peace."
